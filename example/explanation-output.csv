2) gorgeous and practical this is a cool sleek case for the iphone g it fit like a glove and do not add any bulk to the overall size of the iphone so it still fit in your pocket or other small compartment the cutout keep your control buttons and camera lens use the case is very comfortable to hold and definitely keeps the iphone from slip out of your hand so easily that in itself make it worth the money it looks great and the ifrogz logo is barely visible so it doesnt look tacky one thing i really like is that you can slip the case over the touchscreen to protect it if you know its go to be in harm way eg in the bottom of your purse or other bag for a long time the control are not use when the case is in that position but your screen is protect this is a great protector for my new favorite gadget"

2) nice case that still needs some work the most unique thing about the package is the mophie love you lettering that you see under the case once you remove it from the package nice touch and finishthi case has a nice balance of grip and slick grippy enough to be held comfortable and slippery enough to come out of pocket easily the edge are round and i really like the fact that the volume buttons as well as the onoffsleep buttons are actually made easy to use by this case because they are on the outside of the case so no more try to wiggle your finger into a case to hit those hard to reach buttons the opening for the mute switch is large enough but i have found that i need to use my other hand to toggle the switch this is not a big deal to me but you should be aware of itpro nice white led not those cheap look blue one feel like something apple would make grant its not metal and glass physical standby switch with a nice red late for off and green for on seem like it would take some of the shock of a drop but im not go to test that works on the iphone s the speaker hole actually seem to amplify and clarify the sound a bit you dont have to use the special apple charge cable mini usb is a great way to charge and easy to replace the cable at a much lower price slight raise edge around the front of the case to protect the front glass lay on the table design gave me hour of use just on the mophie battery itself with of iphone battery ready to usecon iphone s flash wash out dark photo with the case on price headphone jack opening is to small for old large headphone jack sometimes give error message on iphone when unplugg the unit from the usb charger with apple charger and mophie iphone s is a very phone in the battery department if you are look for a case that will make your phone battery last long with a fair amount of protection this case should fit the bill if you can overlook the con i buy this if mophie address the concern above id be glad to try the next mophie should have included a small usb charger given the cost of this make sure you buy directly from amazon ive read many review of this item talk about cheap knockoff being sold by third party im sure there are some very good third party seller that offer this case but if you want to avoid the possibility of get a fraudulent item get it directly sold and ship from amazon
3) great idea but fit and finishthi case has a very sturdy feel to it it feel like it will protect the iphone very well i like the very grippy outer shell the volume buttons and power switch have rubber outer button overlay that make it very easy to press them the mute switch is easy to get to as wellpro solid protection lip over the outer edge of the screen lay on the table design easy access to buttons and portscon camera hole is to small for flash photography on the iphone s photo appear wash out with flash rubber part under the home button get stretch out over time this got so bad i cut it i buy it thoughtsif you can over look the con above this case is nice however for me those two things are a try to get this directly from amazon if possible i got it from a third party and there return policy is not nearly as nice as amazon so be aware of that
4) love it but huge dealbreaker flaw let me start off with the things i like about this case its very slim considering how much battery power is included i really like the soft touch feel of the case it is slippery enough to come out of my pocket with out much fuss but it is grippy enough that it stays in there when i want it to its great that it use the micro usb standard for charge the casei very easy to put the phone in and take the phone out of they really got the design right on this model accept for one huge flaw use a verizon gb black iphone i placed it in the case then turn the case power on after this i experienced a no signal error i pop the phone out of the case and my signal came back i continue to experience issue every time i put the phone in the case thankful amazon has a great return policy so its get ship back tomorrow again i really see promise in this case but i dont have the patience to mess with tech support so i guess ill go back to an otterbox and a pocket battery"

13) fantastic charger im a huge fan of standalone charge block i know its overkill but i always keep at least two external backup battery in my briefcase at all times these things have save me from being so many times ive try many different brand and different type and size so i have a lot of experience with these of these charger are a commodity they hold a charge they have a usb port or two they do their thing yawn that all there is to itthi one is interesting though at first it look a little gimmicky and i thought i wasnt go to be impress but i was wrongthe huge difference between this power block and its competitor is the digital display some of the other charger i own have no power indicator and some have blinking dot this one actually has a digital display that give you all sort of info at first i was have trouble reading it and thought it was really strange i plug it into the wall and it read charge which seem odd and none of the other indicator that were list in the documentation came on which bug me then i realize that im a moron and was reading the display upside down it was really charged which meant that none of the other indicator should have been on anyway plug in my iphone which was down to about discharge i kept an eye on it while i putter around the kitchen by the time i had the kitchen clean and the dishes wash my iphone was fully charged and the maxboost was only down to charge im no math wiz but i think that means i can get at least three or four charge for my iphone from this right its really nice that the display show the rate of charge or discharge too while charge my iphone it show that it was discharge at a so it was easy for me to see whether i had plug it into the wrong usb port or not very can probably tell that im a geek about these charger it seem like weve all become so dependent on our gadget so its really a shame when they run out of juice these portable charger make it so easy to keep your device fully top offwell done was provided this item for review
14) great cable if it fit this cable is fantastic it is very substantially made and price just right one of my pet peeve about my iphone is that i cant find afford aftermarket cable i refuse to pay top dollar for apple cable but ive also been burn a couple times with cheap knockoff cable that dont work or fall apartthi zeetron cable is very well built plus it has a really nice glowing led indicator that glow blue while the device is charge and red when its done the led works great and looks really nice its great to be able to glance at your phone on the counter and see whether its done charge or not that so much fast than unlock the phone and look at the charge though if you use a bulky case like otterbox case or the lifeproof case the oversize led connect wont fit with your case on im already use to that with my lifeproof case i have to take it off every time i plug anything into the headphone this is a very substantial cable and the led indicator is a fantastic bonus the low price is even that much betteri was provided this item for reviewupdate ive been use this cable for about two month now and its fantastic its durable and always easy to find because the end is lit up i love it
15) play your tune in the shower if youve look through my review youll see that one of my favorite gadget to come to the market in the past few years has been the bluetooth wireless speaker i just love these things i always have my phone with me and my phone is my source of audio entertainment podcast amazon cloud player itune xm radio app pandora etc i feel so spoil have all that entertainment at my fingertip like that the logical extension is the wireless bt speaker i have similar speaker everywhere the kitchen the garage our rv etc my very favorite is in the bathroom though i love to have something play while i brush my teeth shave and particular speaker is great because it can go with me into the shower it sticks onto my glass shower enclosure and play my audio right at head height i can even pick up call if i really want to do something i pretty much refuse to dothi speaker charge life is good so far it has last me over a week without have to recharge make sure you dont misplace the charge cable the small chart connect is part of the waterproof design of this speakerthi speaker put out a decent but modest amount of sound its perfect for the bathroom and shower i would probably stick with my large speaker for space like the garage or kitchen the sound quality is also good but not super high fidelity its just what youd expect from a speaker in your shower except that a little bit of sound go a long way in the showeri was provided this item for review
16) great speakerphone and bt speaker im a big fan of bluetooth bt speaker in general the same go for wireless bt headphone and usb connection on car stereo the fact that i can playback my entire music collection from the phone in my pocket just about anywhere i am continue to blow my mind ive kind of turn into a collector of bt speaker i have one on the sink in my master bathroom in the garage my office and now this one in my kitchen each one is a little different and serve a slightly different purposei think my favorite bt speaker is the one in my bathroom ecoxgear ecoxbt rugged and waterproof wireless bluetooth speaker because its waterproof and i can drag it into the shower with methi spracht conference mate is awesome though its focus is unique compare to the other bt speaker i own its design to function as a speakerphone connected via bt to your smartphone this is fantastic i use my iphone for a lot of conference call when i work at home the call quality isnt as good on my phone speaker setting so i sometimes end up have to hold the phone to participate on the call being able to use a good speakerphone on these call is fantastic even better is the fact that this is a premium speakerphone as good as the one that i use in our conference rooms at work this means that i dont have to sit right on top of the device to participate on the call even better is the fact that more than one of us can comfortable participate in these call nowone of my daughter lives out of state and we like to have family call with her my wife and i love the fact that we can dial her up on my iphone and then set this speaker on the table while we all talk to her sometimes we use video calling on our computer too but the signal is patchy and we always mute the pc and use the phone too this speaker is the perfect solution for those callsthe control on this device are good the volume updown buttons are large and responsive the phone button is good too so when i am play music and someone call i dont need to walk over to my phone i can just press the phone button to take the call a few of the other bt speaker i own have a similar phone function but none of them are as good as this one the rest have terrible mic and the other party has a hard time love this speaker i use it in the kitchen to play music and audio while i cook and clean its more than just a speaker though its perfect for conference call
17) great cable as a general rule price isnt supposed to factor into our amazon review so im go to quick gloss over the fact that this cable current sell for nearly is a great cable its so convenient for me when i think of the device in my life i have apple device that use the lightning connection and all of the rest of my gadget use a micro usb connection this is fantastic for data and chargingmy wife make fun of me for bring a big ziploc bag full of cable wherever i go but i always have the cable i need now i can ditch one of those cable because this one fill the role of two the only thing i cant do is charge two device at what is this cableit a three foot long micro usb cable with a funny thing on the end the funny thing is a micro usb to lightning adapter it is tether to the cable with an even funny look rubber thing this tether can be a little odd to work with so the first couple times you switch the cable from usb to lightning mode you might draw attention to yourself but then after the observer realize that youre charge your iphoneipad with a usb cable theyll realize that youre actually a ninja a clumsy ninja
18) so disappointed ive own many pair of bluetooth earbud and bt dongle for wire earbud and this set of jabra rox bt earbud is by far the worst ive ever use the bt connection is simply horrible the range is bad enough that if i put my iphone in my pocket the signal start to cut out oddly enough its even worse if im not sitting still i take a lot of public transportation commuter train from home to work with a bus connection and when im walking from one leg of my trip to the next the signal skip really badly i have no clue why motion would interfere with the bt signal but it do i dont keep my phone in my pocket because that cause signal problem so walking along the signal skip with almost every stride every time my foot hit the ground at first i thought maybe this was from swinging my arm while i walk which definitely made it worse so now i walk with my phone in the same hand that i hang from my shoulder bag strap and that cut down about of the signal is that just walking down the street i cant imagine how much worse these would be for this is a horrible of the bt have another set of bt earbud that have incredible range more than once ive accidental left my phone on my desk and walk over to the kitchen about away and still had a decent connection i dont demand that same level of connective from these earbud but i shouldnt have to be to make them work eitherso that my primary come the fit and comfort these arent comfortable for me the charger and bt radio are in the earbud themselves which make the body of the driver pretty massive to fix this they give you some rubber barb thingy that are supposed to hook the earbud into the fold of your ear i really dont want that i try to make them work but i couldnt find a combination of earbud size and barb size that would fit into my ear i have pretty big ear but that a lot of rubber to try to wad into my ear hole and then what happen to all that bulk when you take them off and drop them into your bag or pocket nothing good happen that sound quality of these driver is good but who care about fidelity when the signal keeps break up and this price current about i would expect something utterly spectacular this is just the opposite this product is a failure"

2) pretty good my last case was a leather case mate that was pretty torn up after years but provided terrific protection most of that time with my new iphone i need a new one and prefer to have the built in kickstand the speck offer a unique solution to this and overall consider this a decent design add unwanted bulk in fact i want something that made the iphone fat for easy material and decent bottom cross bar that go underneath the home button is weak a point as it is loose already my expectation is that after being pull out of my pocket times it will pull and begin to sag becoming both unattractive and a the stand is novel in its design it seem very fragile if it last a couple of years its stand is too vertical standing at about degree in both portrait and landscape mode this make view close up difficult as on an airplane"

8) nice look but not very protective this is a very nicelooke and even stylish iphone case it has a very interesting pattern on the back which might be one of its most distinguish characteristic it was not too hard to put your phone into it but get it out would be a major case is made out of hard plastic and at first may seem like a good protection for your iphone however it is definitely not as sturdy or protective as the more rubberize and silicone case that ive come across the best case in terms of protection are those that are made out of two layer the hard plastic outer shell and the more rubberize inner shell of course this shell will protect your phone from scratch but that has never been such a huge concern for me iphone doesnt scratch easily and protect its back seem to be particularly pointless over the years ive become quite happy with leave my iphone in its naked form and would only consider use a case for it if it gave me much higher protection from impact unfortunately this belkin case doesnt seem to fit that purpose
9) simple slim case this is a very simple slim and effective case for your iphone s it is easy to install and it fit the iphone very snug it seem fairly protective and will shield your iphone body form most bump and scratch the case leaves total access to all of iphone port and buttons the case is very plasticky though and it detract from the design and build quality elegance of the iphone s it might make it look more like iphone c although i have never use that phone so i wouldnt be able to tell if that in fact the caseif you are look for some inexpensive slim protection for your iphone that doesnt add too much bulk then this just might be the product for you
10) solid capacious extend battery for samsung galaxy s iii a few month ago i decided to get my first android phone this was strict for app and accessory development i still use iphone as my primary phone after fiddling with several phone i finally settled on samsung galaxy siii as my choice it had the best set of all the phone that ive either test or considered however it still has a fair share of shortcoming and ill probably write about those in another review one of the more noticeable shortcoming was its unacceptable short battery life even on the full standby mode the battery would die after only little over a day of use and this is without me even setting up the cell phone coverage so when an opportunity present itself to check out a big capacity battery i immediately decided to seize the far i have been really impress with this zerolemon extend battery it has about three times the capacity of the standard s iii battery and my rough estimate of its life on a single charge is that its about two to three times long than what you normally get the estimate is only rough since the usage and circumstances may vary from day to day and from an individual to individual in terms of battery capacity i am definitely impress with this productthi extend battery attach to your cell phone by remove the back cover and the standard battery the zerolemon battery is too physically large to fit inside the regular cover and hence the back of your phone needs to be cover with the included tpu cover this is an effective albeit not very elegant solution the new cover dramatic alter the look and feel of your phone also even though i have not had any problem with it so far the cover doesnt feel as secure and snug in place as a snapon cover that fit in the back ive seen some other product out there that completely place the extend battery inside of an external cover which to me seem like a sturdy solutionthe cover leaves all of your main port accessible but it cover the side buttons with its own version of the same these are effective but not as responsive as the bare buttons on the phone itselfthe extend battery also make your phone noticeable thick and heavy however if neither the extra bulk nor the esthetic look of your phone are not a concern for you and you really need all the extra power that you can get then this batterycover combo will do the trick i am still not sure how well it perform in the long run but when i find out ill try to post an update to this review
11) cant complain ever since i accidental wash my iphone a few years ago ive been very cognizant of its limitation when it come to the exposure to the wet environment now i will hopefully not make the same mistake again but i do occasional take my iphone to a beach usually i make sure that i am far away from the water but i do dread the prospect of get my most precious gadget wet the frieq universal waterproof case is design to give me a piece of mind so far it has been proven very case is pretty large and made out of very durable plastic it can fit most smartphone ive test it with galaxy s and iphone g and i was also able to put iphone s inside i am not sure if it would fit a large smartphone such as samsung galaxy two latch on top of the case make it easy to shut it off and seal it you just have to twist them and everything is taken care of the top attachment on the case might be the weakest link in the long run i am not sure how it would handle repeated opening and test this case i had dunk my iphone g into a big pot there was no leakage and the phone continue to function i was even able to use it while inside the case but not while it was think this is a great case to have if you engage in a lot of outdoor activity especially near water its an ideal case for a beach or for fishing it can also probably be use for other more activity swimming snorkel kayak etc but in those case i would go for something even more robust overall a pretty good phone case
12) solid phone mount this is a very solid built smartphone car mount that largely deliver on its premise however it has a few shortcoming that may make it less than optimum mount for some of this mount biggest shortcoming is that it doesnt stick to the dashboard easily in some of the promotion pictures for this mount it seem like it can be mount on the dashboard but a close look reveal that the mount is either attach to a smooth side surface or a specialty mat ive been use a weighted dashboard mount for my other gps unit for a while and i was able to mount it that way however portagrip is way too heavy and bulky to stay in place and flip over too the portagrip to the windshield is another story the suction cup is strong and powerful enough to keep the mount stuck there for days in all sort of temperature and weather conditions its not quite as sticky as some other suction cup that ive test but it certainly get the job is very sturdy but its also one of the bulkiest windshield mount that ive come across it doesnt actually obstruct your view that much more than the more mount but its presence is definitely noticeable this mount is more at home in a large pickup truck than it is in say honda good thing about portagrip being this bulky is that it provide you with many adjust option and degree of freedom this is a very flexible mount that can be adjust to fit almost any need or view angle ive test it with iphone s iphone s and samsung galaxy s and it work as advertise with all of them each one of those phone was secure fasten to the mount for duration of the long as you understand and dont mind its limitation this is a good mount that will keep you happy with your smartphone navigation

15) very good external battery this is a fairly spacious and compact power battery mah is enough capacity to charge most smartphone three to four times and to fill up most tablet to full capacity at least once ive test it with iphone s iphone s and galaxy s and the battery perform as expect with all of those device the battery take about four to five hour to fill up completely and it charge my iphone in about two hour ideally you would leave a battery like this one to be charged overnightthe battery is very compact and it fit comfortable with all of your other gadget into a messenger bag for instance it can even fit inside a large pocket but i would not go around with it like that it come with a small usb micro cable that can be use for charge of the android smartphone for instance unfortunately it doesnt include apple charge cable and you would have to provide your ownthi power bank come with several extra features some of which are more useful than other it has a nice led screen which let you know the precise amount of power that is left from to most power bank if they bother with something like this only give you the power remain in quarter of a capacity increment a more precise gauge can really come in handy when you are travelingthe other extra features i am much less enthuse about the power bank come with a an led light a uv light and a laser pointer i have never reach for a power bank to be use as an led flashlight have no use for the uv light and as a laser pointer this power bank is way too bulky you might have different but as far as i am concerned these are not the strong sell points of this power bankthe two extra features that would actually be really useful in a device like this are builtin micro cable built in power outlet prong these two features would ensure that you never have to worry about carry all the extra cable with you unfortunately i have only seen one manufacturer come up with a power bank like that so far
16) solid built and effective headrest mount this is one very effectively built headrest tablet mount it will allow your back seat passenger to view and enjoy entertainment on a tablet computer while driving around or go on a prolonged tripthe mount attach very secure to the headrest bar in your car front seat it is very adjust and will fit almost any seat size the height of the mount position will of course depend on what sort of headrest adjust the person in the front seat is comfortable with the mount handle can be extend to accept most to tablet ive test it with both the original ipad as well as with ipad mini and it work well with both the mount features an adjust ball swivel which allow you to position the mount under almost any angle that you terms of pure esthetics this mount doesnt have that much go for it its very utilitarian in its look made out of very ordinary quality plastic if you are like me and dont give the interior of your car that much thought then this will not be so much of an issue but more car owner might feel that this accessory is out of place in their vehicle in terms of its looki am not sure how durable this stand will be in the long run so far it has been working fine and without any glitche if this change though i will post an update to this review
17) effective multipurpose charger as the number of small electronic device has greatly proliferate in recent years a great new trend has emerge almost all of these device can be charged use some form of the standard usb charger even though at the device end of the charge cable there are still many existing standard the usb plug seem to justify the u in its name it is becoming pretty near universal however the sheer number of such device that i travel with iphone ipad kindle headphone etc still means that i usually have to remember to take with me at least three or four charger if i am to be able to charge all of my gadget simultaneous this is why i am always excited to come across a solution that can simplify my digital life and make it more tractable this wall charger is definitely one such devicethi charger enable you to simultaneous charge up to four different device two of its usb port carry a current and the other two carry a current the former are more suitable for large device such as tablet while the latter are ideal for charge smartphone or use this charger several times already and was indeed able to charge four device simultaneous the charger is pretty solid built and it seem pretty reliablei do have a couple of issue with this charger though it is pretty bulky there are several external batterycharger that are as large and those have the advantage of serving dual purpose the wall prong are not this might not be as much of an issue with the small charger but putt this kind of charger in your travel bag directly is less than this charger were about half as large and had retractable prong it would be an ideal travel accessory even so it is a very valuable gadget that can greatly simplify your life
18) compact and convenient one of the things that is both frustrate and impressive about apple is that they are willing to innovate at all level of product development including the port and cable that their device use this is frustrate because it often means that apple product are not compatible with many other standard device that are very readily available out there but its also admirable because their product oftentime exceed the quality and use of the standard one the recent switch of the ios device to the lightning input and cable is a case in point it overnight made million thirdparty gadget and cable obsolete it also made a big departure from apple own line of product but it is by most measure a very good cable for one its much easy to use than the micro usb connection you dont have to squint every time at the connection when you are try to connect your devicesthe problem with apple cable however is that its very hard for the thirdparty developer to get the license to manufacture them this is why i am always delight when i come across a thirdparty product that is innovate and useful this little nomad cable certainly fit the bill it is small and it convenient attach to your ring chain the regular usb side of the cable come easily off form the cap that attach it to your keychain the cable is very short about three inch and it seamless connect between your ios device and the regular usb port you can use it to quick charge your iphone or ipad from a spare port on your computer i use it in conjunction with an external battery that i now always carry around you can also carry it with you in a messenger bag or a purse overall this is a very nicely design and convenient little cable
19) really impressive compact external battery new trent has been at the leading edge of innovation in the portable backup power solution for the mobile device powerpak is their latest product aim primarily at the mobile phone user but it works equally well with tablet and other device that need recharge onthego it is a very compact and elegant product which ought to find a place in a messenger bag or the suitcase of every commuter or road bottom line on this new trent battery is this it works in the past ive try several different reserve power supplies for my gadget and i have had mixed result however there is no ambiguous about this battery its capacious effective versatile and well design its one of the largest external battery that ive come across in terms of capacity with impressive mah of charge and yet its much small in size than all of its large nearcompetitorsin order to test this battery charger i decided to completely drain my small electronic device so that i get as clean of an idea of this battery efficiency as i can as an aside when you really want to discharge them the consumer electronics has become really robust in recent year it took me much long than i thought it would i had to blast music from my iphone for hour and hour i discover that i was able to fully charge all of my small electronic device with plenty of power to spare most of them i was able to charge several times and thanks to dual usb port was able to charge up to two device at once full charge usually take between one to two hour ive test this battery with iphone s iphone g kindle paperwhite mobee magic bar jabra sport bluetooth stereo headset and the first generation ipad gb wifi g oftentime i was able to fully charge four or five device with just one fully charged new trent battery i was also able to charge my ipad to completely and even charge it to almost half its capacity the second time around if there was an easy way of connect this battery to an ultrabook i would not be surprise if it would be possible to charge it to a decent amount as wellthe battery come with a micro usb cable that allow you to charge it by either connect it to a computer or a standalone usb charger the battery looks and to some extent feel like an oversize iphone s there is no doubt in my mind which device the new trent designer had in mind when designing this batterythere are a couple of design features that would make this battery pack even more appealing to me i wish it had retractable prong that would allow it to be directly charged from a wall socket even more so i wish it had an attach micro usb cable or even better a lightning cable unfortunately this would probably significant increase the price of such a battery especially when the lightning cable is concerned but such a batterycharger would indeed be a perfect onthego power supply
20) capacious elegant and portable external battery the bottom line on the greatshield battery is this it works in the past ive try several different reserve power supplies for my gadget and i have had mixed result however there is no ambiguous about this battery its large effective versatile and well design its one of the largest external battery that ive come across in terms of capacity with impressive mah of charge and yet its much small in size than some of its large nearcompetitorsin order to test this battery charger i decided to completely drain my small electronic device so that i get as clean of an idea of this battery efficiency as i can as an aside when you really want to discharge them the consumer electronics has become really robust in recent year it took me much long than i thought it would i had to blast music from my iphone for hour and hour i discover that i was able to fully charge all of my small electronic device with plenty of power to spare most of them i was able to charge several times and thanks to dual usb port was able to charge up to two device at once full charge usually take between one to two hour ive test this battery with iphone s iphone g kindle keyboard mobee magic bar jabra sport bluetooth stereo headset and the first generation ipad gb wifi g oftentime i was able to fully charge four or five device with just one fully charged greatshield battery i was also able to charge my ipad to completely and even charge it to almost half its capacity the second time around if there was an easy way of connect this battery to an ultrabook i would not be surprise if it would be possible to charge it to a decent amount as wellthe battery come with a micro usb cable that allow you to charge it by either connect it to a computer or a standalone usb charger i think this would have been a much more effective product if it had two addition that some of its competitor already incorporate into their bank incorporated walloutlet prong for easy charge and a permanent attach retractable micro usb cable these two addition would make this battery stand out in the already very crowded field of external greatshield battery is also beautiful design you would not be ashamed of being spotted with this battery at a trendy tech conference the battery is very easy to use and operate and overall vey intuitive design
21) small convenient effective there is a whole variety of phone charger and external battery out there so it can be confuse decide on which one to pick the choice will ultimately come down to your needs if you spend most of your time near a wall outlet then your standard wall charger will be all that you will almost ever need if you spend a lot of time travel especially via a plane and you tend to carry a lot of gadget with you then i would recommend you look into get at least a mah external battery for everything in between you can select the battery size closest to your needs and the kind of gadget you carry around i would not recommend go below a mah battery though the small battery will probably not be sufficient big for a full recharge if you dont remember to charge them up is a very nice effective and compact battery it is slightly thinner than iphone s and just a bit wide it can be easily carry around in a small messenger bag briefcase or a purse it can even fit in a pocket hey it is the size of a phone but i would personally not recommend itthe battery doesnt come with its own charge adapter or cable which is not such a big deal for me i have plenty of micro usb cable lay around the battery has two charge port and a permanent attach charge micro usb cable this feature make this battery particularly suitable for those who use that kind of charge input if you are an idevice user however you will have to reach for your own apple usb cablethe charge time for this battery was pretty quick as was the charge of external device i was able to fully charge my iphone with plenty of room to spare i was even able to charge my ipad to about of its capacity i also try it with several other microusb charge device galaxy s kindle headphone and it work fine with all of them although i did not test them fully to ascertain the total charge timeoverall i am very pleased with this battery and would recommend it to anyone who is in a need of small extra charge while on the go
22) good idea well execute i use a lot of gadget in the car but the lack of charge outlet usually prevent me from use more than a couple at the time this charge split is a great answer to those dilemma it allow me to connect a usbcharg device while leave the cigarette lighter socket available for another use grant most modern device today use usb charge to begin with so a dual usb charger for the cigarette socket would more or less serve the same purpose in those case however there are enough legacy device out there that will only work when directly plug in the cigarette lighter that this charger really come in handythe charger is reasonably well built it plug in secure into the lighter socket the small blue led light around the usb plug can be handy at night but it can also be a detract those small lights are very bright for their sizei have test this charger while simultaneous use an iphone and a radar detector it perform as advertise with both unit i am pretty happy with its function and would recommend it to anyone look for a similar charger
23) powerful and effective car charger ive come across and use quite a few of usb car charger there are a couple of features unique to this charger that set it apart from other one that ive test dual a usb outlet and socket lighter plug the first one of these features is important because the usb outlet that provide more than a of current are ideal for charge tablet device they also work with most smartphone these days as well and will charge your device more than twice as fast as the small ordinary a usb outlet furthermore the available of the socket lighter plug ensure that you will still have an additional plug available for all of your incar electronic device that still dont use usb test this charger by simultaneous use it with my iphone ipad and a radar detector i was able to charge both of my idevice effectively while still being able to use the detector the front console of my car did get a bit clutter with all these wire though and you definitely dont want to be fiddling with charge your gadget while driving i would strong recommend that you plug all of your device before setting on a trip or have someone in the passenger seat do it for youthe charger overall seem very solid built this is particularly the case of the metal lighter charger contact the design is not particularly fancy or elegant this is a charger that is design primarily with the utilitarian end in mind i do wish that the lighter plug socket came with some kind of a cap leave it expose doesnt seem very elegant or safe
24) effective compact external battery there are many external battery out there that can help you recharge your portable device and which one you choose will depend on your particular needs this mah external batterycharger is one of the smallest ive seen both in terms of physical size as well as charge capacity the battery looks similar in shape and size to a smartphone although it is small than most smartphone model ive come across the battery is charged from an usb port and it come with its own micro usb cable you can charge it by plug it into a spare usb outlet on your pc slow or by use one of the wall usb outlet from your cell phone or a similar device been able to use this battery to fully charge a samsung galaxy s phone and iphone s it took me a few hour to charge both of those device in order to charge an iphone i had to use my own iphone cable apple is very restrictive when it come to allow third party manufacturer use their proprietary this battery is very small it is ideally suit for an emergency backup charge it can easily fir in your pocket along with your smartphone although i wish that it came with a small bag into which to put itthe battery is well design and looks nice along with all of my other small electronic device there is nothing that looks or feel cheap about it except perhaps the package that it come in it is hard for me to ass at this point how durable this battery is but right now i am give it the benefit of a doubt
25) monster power bank ive use and test many external battery and oxa frost box f is the largest one ive ever come across large even than the mah external battery which was the previous record holder for me as you would expect from such a device it can hold a lot of juice ive test it with several small and medium electronic device which i had previous completely deplete i was able to fully charge first generation ipad iphone s iphone s galaxy s and ipad mini all from a single charged frost box f and with plenty of leftover charge i have not test it with the latest generation ipad air but my guess would be that frost box f would be able to fully charge it at least three timesthe battery come with its own power supply and all the cable youd need in order to connect it to most pc laptop ive test it with two of my old laptop an ace and an hp model and it was able to fully charge both of them as you can expect it charge a laptop can take a while so this is not a battery that will get you to full charge in an instant fortunately it can still be rely upon to power your laptop while its own battery is being charged ive also discover frost box f take a really long time to charge i recommend have it charged i have not been able to use this power bank to charge mac laptop it doesnt come with cable and connect that will enable it to connect to a mac this is not just the problem with this battery apple is notorious for being very proprietary with their accessory connection and i dont think there is an independent battery manufacturer out there with a product that will work with mac there are some hack that will allow you to get around this restriction you can buy an apple power cord or appropriate one from your old charger but all such trick require certain level of familiarity with electronics and willing to you have any regular pc laptop chance are that this battery pack will work with it the battery support several different voltage output v and v and come with a gazillion adapter that can fit pretty much any laptop power input that ive come is a beautiful made external battery its metal casing is stylish elegant and very sturdy it is as you would expect it fairly large and heavy it weigh gram not including the power brick or almost a pound and a half this may not be an ideal emergency battery that you carry with you everywhere in your messenger bag but it is a great backup resource to have if you find yourself on a long business trip or vacation in many respects this is a standout product that is in a class of its last caveat battery of this size can get pretty hot make sure you are in a well ventilate space and away from all possible hazard personally i would recommend have a small fan somewhere near this battery while its in use
26) convenient portable power bank there are many external battery out there that can help you recharge your portable device and which one you choose will depend on your particular needs this mah external batterycharger is one of the smallest ive seen both in terms of physical size as well as charge capacity the battery looks similar in shape and size to an elongate lighter the battery is charged from an usb port and it come with its own micro usb cable with several different charge attachment you can charge it by plug it into a spare usb outlet on your pc slow or by use one of the wall usb outlet from your cell phone or a similar device been able to use this battery to fully charge a samsung galaxy s phone and iphone s it took me a few hour to charge both of those device in order to charge an iphone i had to use my own iphone cable apple is very restrictive when it come to allow third party manufacturer use their proprietary this battery is very small it is ideally suit for an emergency backup charge it can easily fit in your pocket along with your smartphone although i wish that it came with a small bag into which to put itthi is neither a particularly stylish design nor remarkably well built external battery it has a very utilitarian look and fee to it it get the job done at least for now i have not test it long enough to see how durable it is in the long run and if i discover anything noteworthy about that ill update my small external charger especially for the price
27) neat and fun look wireless charger i am fairly new to the world of qi wireless charge and i am so glad that this technology seem to be finally taking off juggle various cable and dock for all of my small electronic device is increasingly becoming a major hassle as wifi and bluetooth are becoming ubiquitous i am really look forward to the days when well be able to finally sever the last cable that is keeping all of those device wire qi seem to be the answer to all of those far as i know there is only a handful of smartphone that use qi charge native my samsung galaxy s doesnt have it but i was able to get a small qi charge pad that turn it into a qi enable qi charger is a small device that is very neat design it is very thin portable and it is also very fun to look at the small footprint and the smooth surface of this charger mean that you will have to be very careful when position your smartphone directly on top of it for charge there is not much wiggle room in terms of hit the charge sweet spot the charger also use a proprietary charge cable i would have much prefer if it use the micro usb technology time can take quite a while this is not a kind of charger that you would want to use in a hurry however because of the ease of use of a wireless charger have your phone charged on an intermittent basis now become a very convenient option just put your phone on top of this charger whenever you are not use it and you will almost never again have to deal with low battery that in itself make this qi charger a very worthwhile product to have aroundthi charger is also very afford even if you have to buy an extra wireless adapter for your phone battery your total cost will still be comparable or even lower than the cost of some wire charger
28) nice welldesigne car mount this is a very solid built smartphone car mount that largely deliver on its premise it attach easily and secure to either your windshield or your dashboard the suction cup is strong and powerful enough to keep the mount stuck there for days in all sort of temperature and weather conditions its not quite as sticky as some other suction cup that ive test but it certainly get the job done this is a very flexible mount that can be adjust to fit almost any need or view angle ive test it with iphone s iphone s and samsung galaxy s and it work as advertise with all of them each one of those phone was secure fasten to the mount for duration of the test the mount also allow for an easy access to all of the said phone port and buttons although you really dont want to fiddle with those while driving as for the build quality this mount certainly feel sturdy and fairly elegant although it do not quite come close to some of the highend car mount ive try
29) great compact battery backup this is a very convenient and small external battery charger its ideal for the onthego situation where you want to be sure that youll have extra power on hand in the case your smartphone runs out of powerthe mah battery capacity is nominal sufficient to fully charge most smartphone out there for instance iphone s battery capacity is little over mah while galaxy s has a mah battery keep in mind that there is some inefficient associate with the charge process so that the amount of power that you get will be about of the nominal battery capacity i have been able to fully charge my iphone s and galaxy s ive also been able to charge my first generation ipad to about of its capacity but this small battery is definitely not meant to be use with tablet the battery use va for both the input and the output which is the typical voltagecurrent for most smartphone chargersthi battery has a very basic cylinder look most of the body is made out of an aluminum pipe the pipe actually screw in at one end so you can open up this battery and take a look at its innards those are not particularly pretty to look at a big cylinder battery tape to a small board the battery has a small led light at one end that glow when the battery is being charged or discharge the whole battery looks like a big roll of the other end of the battery has a small led flashlight this form factor is actually ideally suit for such function but unfortunately the lightbulb is not very bright if the manufacturer were to increase the lumen in the future version of this product then this could really be a very convenient multipurpose battery come with a inone usb cable that has both the micro usb and the apple pin end this is one of the few such battery that include the apple cable but its probably not applecertify the cable work fine with my iphone s and first generation ipad but as apple phase out the pin cable in favor of the lightning cable this charger cable will become this battery is pretty reasonably price i am not sure how reliable it is in the long run but so far ive had pretty good experience with it it doesnt have all the bell and whistle of the some of the more sophisticated battery that are available out there but so far it has gotten the job done just as advertise
30) my new favorite dashboard phone mount ive got to use this mount for a few week and so far i am really impress by it the one touch springloade phone attachment mechanism at first didnt seem like such a big deal but after use it for a while i think this is one of the biggest innovation with the dashboardwindshield smartphone mount that ive come across attach my phone or a standalone gps device has always involved quite a bit of fiddling but with this mount all of that is finally over all you have to do is press the mount on the side which open it up and then place the phone in its cradle and then voila the springloade arms snatch into place and hold your phone tight and securelyi am also really pleased with all other aspect of this mount it attach very secure to either the dashboard or the windshield i have not had any problem with either the phone fall off or the mount get detached while driving it is overall very sturdy and solid built highly recommend
31) pretty good waterproof bluetooth speaker i have never been one to enjoy singing in the shower but i always appreciate being able to listen to the music on the beach this small and effective portable bluetooth speaker enable me to partake in both of those activity and so ive discover the pleasure of listen to the music in my bathroomthe speaker is very well built overall with the rubberize outer shell covering most of its front and the side ive discover that the covering has slightly start to peel off on one of the side but this has not affected this speaker look or performancethe speaker was easy to pair up with my iphone once it is turn on it become visible in the list of bluetooth device i am not sure how easy it is to pair it up with other smartphone tablet and computer but my guess would be that it should not be much of the problem eitherthe sound quality was pretty good especially for a device of this size if you end up mostly use it in the shower room then there will be some entire expect audio distortion due to the small size of the surrounding space there are also limitation to the sound quality of any device that use bluetooth standard for the signal transmission but unless you are a very strict audiophile this will not be much of an issue for you use this speaker in the shower for a few week and so far have not had any problem with the sound damage if however something do go wrong at some point i will make sure to update this reviewoverall i am very pleased with this speaker i would recommend it to anyone look for a small and convenient speaker to be use in the very wet space product sample provided for review purpose
32) works great with all of my ios device i am weary of thirdparty ios cable and dock station most of them are not apple certify and either dont work properly with your idevice or stop working once apple make an upgrade to ios from the experience ive learned to trust and value the official apple accessory like this ayl lightning cable i am happy to report that so far i have not had any issue with it the cable overall looks very elegant and well design it come in a small box that is easy to open ive test it with ipad mini running ios and the latest iphone s and it has work both for charge as well as for data sync the cable length of six feet m is also very convenient for all sort of situation highly recommend to all owner of ios device
33) surprising impressive ive use so many bluetooth headset over the years that i have literally lost count i primarily use these headset in the gym and while running they are ideally suit for the situation where you dont want to have any cords dangle around your head however most of the one ive use even the top quality from brand are sadly not waterproof and all of them have a tendency to fail after few month of use so i have reluctantly accept the fact that as long as i insist on use the bluetooth headset in the gym i will have to replace the headset on a somewhat regular basis this is one of the main reason why i have a strong preference for cheap headset that just get the work done in that regard this senbowe headset is ideal for my purpose its quality however turn to be much higher than i had expect sound quality ive come to expect that the bluetooth headset especially the small one dont have the best sound quality this is mostly ok for my purpose use the headset to listen to the music while working out however this senbowe headset has a surprising high quality of music the sound is clear and crisp and i actually enjoy listen to the music coming from this headset it will of course not impress any diehard audiophile but for an inexpensive sports headset this is probably the best sound quality that you will come across comfort there are several earbud option that come with this headset so they will probably fit into almost any ear the fit is pretty comfortable and the headset doesnt fall off while running it is extremely lightweight probably the lightest one ive come across so much so that i could barely feel its presence up it took a bit of fiddling around but i essentially had not problem pair up this headset with my iphone s i dont like the fact that this headset use a somewhat nonstandard charge cable a thin barrel one instead of the more customary micro usb cable the charge port is also expose which could be an issue with the prolonged use sweat and water could get in there and damage it product provided for review purpose
34) interesting and useful product this is a very neat and interesting product it is not without its share of shortcoming but overall i think it works pretty well for its intended purpose here are some of my quick observationsthe mah internal battery is a bit mediocre in terms of its capacity it will allow you to fully charge your smartphone once maybe twice it will not be sufficient for to fully charge a tablet except maybe some of the small one i think that this kind of device should boast at least a mah internal battery to be a really worthwhile feature to have however it is still a pretty compact external battery and if you are in the need of the extra features voice recording and flashlight then it could be a really good accessory to carry around for emergency purposesthe battery like many other such device features a small led light its a neat feature to have in case of an emergency and ive use such a feature on a numerous occasion it is not the brightest light youll come across but it get the job donethe is overall well design and looks and feel pretty solid most of these external power bank have a limited number of chargedischarge cycle i am not sure how long this one would last but i am guess that it would be on par with other such device in this voice recording feature is something that truly distinguish this power bank from many of the similar one it provide you with a quick accessible and largely inconspicuous way of recording conversation you turn on the voice recorder by holding the onoff button for three seconds and similarly you turn it off by the same procedure the quality of audio recording that this recorder provide is pretty mediocre i would not recommend it for music recording but for voice it get the job done all the recording are store to the included micro sd card and they are easily retrieve by transfer them to your computerif you do need a quick and inconspicuous voice recorder yet dont care about the professional or even good quality sound then this recorder might be a good choice especially if you dont envision yourself use a recorder on a very regular basis for very casual voice recording in a very simple and uncluttered environment id recommend that you just use the voice recording option on your smartphone for more serious recording use you will be better off with a sony or similar recorder product sample provided for review purpose
35) innovate and effective this is a well design innovate and effective external power bank the mah capacity is sufficient to charge your smartphone three to four times depend on a model it can also be sufficient for charge your tablet computer i have test it with iphone s galaxy s and the first generation ipad i was able to fully charge my ipad and had no problem charge iphone and galaxy several timesthe power bank has a micro usb port that allow it to get charged however it doesnt come with its own usb charger so you are left to use one of your spare one or charge it by plug it into a spare usb port on your computerthere are two regular usb port on the front of this power bank one supplies a current and the other one a a one the lower one is usually use by smartphone while tablet are charged via the higher one however these days either one of them can be use with almost any device the only major difference will be the charge speed two usb port also allow you to charge two device at the same times will vary by the device from just over an hour for a small device to almost four hour for ipad these times are more or less typical for external charger that i have work with charge of the power bank itself take several hour and is best done by leave it plug in overnight there are a few small led lights that tell you the total charge capacity remain which is a very useful featurethe most innovate feature of this power bank is that it doubles as a smartphonetablet stand the stand will support your smartphone or a tablet while its being charged or can be use as a standalone stand the stand is a bot on the small side for a tablet stand it works more than adequate for my iphone but i rarely if ever need a stand for it i think that this stand is optimum for a to small tablet but i have not been able to test it with any one of those to know for sure the good thing about the stand is that its easily fold so it doesnt add much bulky to the battery while you are a couple of features that some other power bank come with which would have made this an even more handy charger my favorite is a pair of builtin wall outlet prong the second favorite is the wraparound attach micro usb charge cable inclusion of those two features ensure that if you have an android phone for instance you never have to worry about bring along any other cable or charger with youoverall this looks like a decent and innovate product and so far i have had pretty good experience with it product provided for review purpose
36) decent small battery this is a very convenient and small external battery charger its ideal for the onthego situation where you want to be sure that youll have extra power on hand in the case your smartphone runs out of powerthe mah battery capacity is nominal sufficient to fully charge most smartphone out there once or twice for instance iphone s battery capacity is little over mah while galaxy s has a mah battery keep in mind that there is some inefficient associate with the charge process so that the amount of power that you get will be about of the nominal battery capacity i have been able to fully charge my iphone s and galaxy s ive also been able to charge my first generation ipad to about of its capacity this battery could potential be useful with the small and tablet as well but i have not had a chance to test it with any of though this power bank works well enough and it seem adequate for most purpose for which its intended its design and build quality dont exactly scream high quality and elegance the exterior shell is built out of two pieces of plastic that were snap together and the join edge is a bit sharp and i am not a total design snob but the build quality of this battery make me wonder how durable it is in the long run i would have also appreciate some way of gauge the total charge capacity as it is its impossible to tell how much charge you have left before the battery discharge completelyi also think that at this battery is reasonably price it doesnt have all the bell and whistle of the some of the more sophisticated battery that are available out there but so far it has gotten the job done just as advertise product sample provided for review purpose
37) capacious elegant and portable external battery the bottom line on the lifecharge battery is this it works in the past ive try several different reserve power supplies for my gadget and i have had mixed result however there is no ambiguous about this battery its large effective versatile and well design its one of the largest external battery that ive come across in terms of capacity with impressive mah of charge and yet its much small in size than some of its large nearcompetitorsin order to test this battery charger i decided to completely drain my small electronic device so that i get as clean of an idea of this battery efficiency as i can as an aside when you really want to discharge them the consumer electronics has become really robust in recent year it took me much long than i thought it would i had to blast music from my iphone for hour and hour i discover that i was able to fully charge all of my small electronic device with plenty of power to spare most of them i was able to charge several times and thanks to dual usb port was able to charge up to two device at once full charge usually take between one to two hour ive test this battery with iphone s iphone g kindle keyboard mobee magic bar jabra sport bluetooth stereo headset and the first generation ipad gb wifi g oftentime i was able to fully charge four or five device with just one fully charged lifecharge battery i was also able to charge my ipad to completely and even charge it to almost half its capacity the second time around if there was an easy way of connect this battery to an ultrabook i would not be surprise if it would be possible to charge it to a decent amount as wellthe battery come with a micro usb cable that allow you to charge it by either connect it to a computer or a standalone usb charger i think this would have been a much more effective product if it had two addition that some of its competitor already incorporate into their bank incorporated walloutlet prong for easy charge and a permanent attach retractable micro usb cable these two addition would make this battery stand out in the already very crowded field of external batteriescharger product provided for review purpose"

2) must have if you use your cell phone this is an awesome little gadget i have an iphone which doesnt have the best battery life on a normal day i barely have any charge left by night time when i charge my phone and if i happen to use it for things other than check email and facebook during the day then i run out of juice i carry this in my purse and when i start running low on power just plug in the usb cable and charge it charge fairly quick and the item itself hold a charge for quite a long time i havent time how long but ive gone a few week with it in my purse and was still able to connect my friends phone to it for a quick charge the best part is you can charge two item at once so as long as you have different cable with you you and a friend can simultaneous charge phone ive also use it to charge my ipad along with my iphone and it had no problem whatsoever im sure as an you can offer to charge for a price in place where there is no electricity available as well
3) great charger for use in your car ive try out both of the new trent combo pack dual usb cigarette car charger they both work well and charge my iphone and ipad nicely the diamond shaped one has a small body which seem to not work too well in my car i had some trouble plug in the usb cable into that charger and it kept turning around in the socket the design is good if the passenger and driver need to charge item since the plug are design so that one cord go to the left and the other to the right however i didnt like use it because of the fact that it was somewhat loose in the socket my son the driver didnt mindi much prefer the other charger in this combo pack it has a cool blue light which my son also like the body is a bit long and i found it fit in the plug much better it has two different voltage clearly marked so i was able to charge my iphone and ipad at the same time i found that by plug my iphone into the a plug it charged a bit fast both plug do face forward but in my car the socket are off to the side as oppose to the middle of the panel so it doesnt interfere with the gear i like both charger they are very well made sturdy and do their job i wish they both had a more flat design so that they didnt stick out from the socket but i do have one that is almost flush with the panel and it has remain in the socket because i just cant get it out so it probably is better that they stick out because i can remove them and swap them much easy they both charge well though i will most likely be use the one with the light over the diamond shaped one"

5) best portable battery i have use test of powerpak ultra new trent powerpak ultra is an excellent portable battery it deliver a greater percentage of its rate capacity to recharge device than any other portable power supply i have testedthe form factor is very good but not great the thickness interfere with ultimate portable and the weatherproof while arguable useful add bulk and weight for in my opinion a poor tradeoff there is no doubt that the package is rugged and durable but the device must be protect like any other while it is in use for some this will have value but i would rather have less weight and small sizein all this is one of the very best portable power solution available on the market at this time it deliver on its promise of capacity rugged and weatherproof which is a breath of fresh air in a market that and the value for your money is extremely high i cannot recommend the new trent powerpak ultra highly enough to those who require extra durable and environmental resistance it has little or no real competition in its price class or level of qualitymy final rating of the new trent powerpak ultra ntrb is an easy stars out of form trent have create the maximum protection in the minimum space and weight corner are nicely round and the rubbery side afford a very good grip without add features that are unnecessary new trent have add exactly what is need and nothing more to create rugged and waterproof i have seal the port cover on this as direct and submerge the powerpak ultra in of water for hour and there was no detect leakage this battery is great for people that are in wet and muddy environment that will be able to use it for charge in a more control environment remember that when you open a port cover to charge a device the water resistance is gone i travel a lot in my job on foot and by public transport my battery stay either in my scottevest or my waterproof backpack so my personal perspective may be different from yours nevertheless i still feel that it is a bit large and a bit heavy i use my scottevest jacket all the time and this power supply do not fit well into the space i report weight is ounce and i have measured it at rate capacity is mah i always approach rate capacity with great skepticism when these type of device first came out in the s i found the actual deliver capacity very close to the rate capacity in recent years there are very many of these portable battery device available and i have found that almost all the one i have test deliver only to of their rate capacity it is not that difficult to test the battery that you manufacture and give it a true rating instead of give an inflated rating and then talk about power loss etc just give the battery the proper rating of what the customer can expect from it that said new trent have produce a battery in the powerpak ultra that come close to deliver what it is rate to deliver than any other battery i have test except for aa battery such as the eneloop etc i have use three device to test the charge deliver galaxy note edition galaxy s t and an anker cell phone battery charger following is a table of three set of charge that i have compile the device were turn off during charge so the full charge can be measured not inclusive of running the device the second table show another feature of the new trent powerpak ultra that i greatly appreciate the led charge indicator lights actually represent pretty close the actual remain charge it can be seen from the table that although not exact the led indicator are close to true than any other battery i have test this is a big help to not have to guess the remain charge as you have to with other unit it is waste cost to include battery level indicator that are as hopeless inaccurate as other i have test here again new trent has add real value by making the basic function work properly instead of being poorly design delivery test table charge device charge deliver of rate capacity recharge time mah hour mah hour mah charge remain indicator test table led remain"

8) good bluetooth headset but not excellent i am a tech junkie and this headset fit well within my profile naturally i had to try it out to get a feel for etymotic and my result were not in the star it score very high on everything it lack on sound quality in the ear i will begin with the pro and con and then give you my included headset usb to microusb cable sponge cover for boom extra tip for different ear a replacement filter so when the original filter is clog with earwax you can replace and finally a ear battery lifeeasy charge via computer or charger micro usb now standard on all mobile length for boom noise charger included not that we dont have a dozen lay would be nice to get oneon usb to microusb cable quality is very tinny its almost too sharp for the human high powerpaire button too led do not come on when unit turn on have to count on handset to see if its connectedthe device i use to test this headset with were the blackberry torch and the iphone the audio quality on both device was similar if there was a difference i did not hear has one of the best voice dial features and thus my first test was to see how this headset would work with voice command while driving mph on a highway the headset work flawless thereby indicate that the noise reduction feature is excellent the receiving party also said the audio sound clear and there was minimal noise from the radio play at minimal volume and or wind noise in the car at high speed this is where it score high the audio quality again was similar to that of the blackberry and the receiving party again state that there was minimal noise from the radio or wind noise again high did not test too thorough with the iphone as my blackberry is my primary device of choicethe reason i give it is because i simply was not thrill by the audio quality in my was very high pitch and made me remove the headset i also think that at this price point the manufacturer should include a this is not a deal breaker the headset also ranks low due to the high price point is kind of all things considered noise cancellation do have a premium it is a good product and deserve a but i think it could use some mild improvement
9) not so much love for this product i was really excited to try this mount kit for my because it include a disc that let you mount on various surface if your windshield is out of reach however the excitement quick came to an endthe adhesive on the disc was quite useless and it would not stick to the vinyl dashboard in my car for what i like is that it include the cable and cigarette lighter adapter to charge your device it is also really well design to fit a myriad of you plan on mount to your windshield with the excellent suction than this is for youother should probably look elsewhere
10) excellent casefeel great and provide adequate protection not much to say about an iphone casebut this one is greatlike it cover the volume buttons and sleep button at the scuff mark it is a bit hard and thus will provide adequate protection the look is black with a highlight around the edge leaves the cutout for the lightning connect headphone jack speaker and sound switch provide an adequate gripbut is smooth enough to slip into pants overly for me excellent product
11) if you need a is the oneand lte to boot i am very fortunate in that i live in a market where lte was turn up about month ago perfect timing for me to try this device out and let you know what i this is a hotspot that connect to the att wireless network at lte and or g as need you are then able to connect of your device to this hotspot wireless network so they can all share a connection to the internet technical people already know thisbut my review is for everyone and thus i am providing the basic information abovethi particular unit is wonderful in that it make it easy for every level user to get setup and running and have their various device our case ipad in the car for long device has a touch screen interface which display a wealth of information making it easy to manage the top of the device show the signal strength connection type lte g etc and battery life right underneath that you will see the wifi network name and password along with a status bar that show how much of your allot data has been usedthi is very helpful so you can manage your allot data base on your get main option on the screen wifi message and selection you can change the ssid wifi network name and password for your personal wifi network it will also let you manage which device are connected you can also setup a guest network may be a bit overkill but a nice add this section basically show you text may send you some if you are close to your data cap simple here you can adjust bright of the display check the connection to the att network and even apply software update note if you have a laptop connected to this hotspot there is a built in web base setup utility that can be access for even more life i cannot honestly say that i use this device for more than hour at a timebut over days i was able to get a full hour of usage before i was concerned that it need to be i test this in lte near my home in nj and one in new york city the experience in nyc was much better than nj but nj was not bad at all my nyc speed were approximate mbp down and about mbp up the nj speed were about mbp down and up not horrible for being on the this device is best kept to short distance i mention above that we have use it in a all of the device connected to it were in close proximity i also test this in my office and i was about feet away from it i did not test for long distance as i did not see the only concern with this device would be the cost of a data if you are a limited user and use a prepaid data plan as do i for this device than you will be you will only recharge as need att offer three option mb for mb for and gb for the plan all are base on days or until the data is all use upafter which you can buy productif you are in the market for an lte hotspot than look no furtherthi is the easiest best look and most functional device out there for everyday user
12) love itjust wish it was a bit long a stylus is one of those item that has to feel right in your hand before you can determine if it is right for you or not this particular design to me was perfect and it had the right amount of weight that i want in a like a good professional pen my only issue was that it was a tiny bit short and thus sometimes a bit difficult to use initially after a few days it feel normal and i continue to use it dailyi use this on my samsung galaxy s iphone and ipad mini without any issue green is total cool for me excellent
13) easy to use stylish but lack functional boostcase is a great look product with a simplistic design too simplistic basically you get a plastic case for your iphone that then on to the boost case you press a button and your phone is charge when you need the extra juice so why then did i give it great design and looks stores more then ample power to get your phone from to about con the switch on the back is nonfunctional at best and will get pressed in your bag pocket etcthe idea is use their iphone case included and slide it on to the boost case when you need extra juice press a button on back of the boost case and phone is up and charge the way they would intend this to work is that you keep the phone with the slim case in your pocket and the boostcase close by in a bag etcso you can use it when you need power work it there is one problem i personally want to keep the boostcase on the phone similar to a mophie and slide the entire thing in my pocket the boostcase has a tactile button on the rear of it that must be pressed to activate the extra power and charge your phonegreat problem is when you leave the boostcase on and throw your phone in a pocket bag etcthe tactile button get pressed easily and your phone constant charged while this is functional you will soon realize that the boost case is out of power and that you no long have any boost capacity left fail they should have included a standard hard slide power switch so you could turn the boost case on and off as require learn from like the case i like the look i dont like the tactile button design and for that alone i cannot recommend this product there is a picture on the product page that show the tactile button in the backi am sure upon look at it you will agree with my me this is still a star product because it is very stylish and functional it just needs some improvement to get to a star
14) excellent solution my review heading say it all this product is excellent price well and extremely another battery pack built well feel great and include a wrist strap and usb to microusb cable for offif i could change one thing it would be the length of the usb cordthe one provided is about is a bit plug in the usb cable to a computer or other usb charger i use my iphone charger and charged this battery pack for a full overnight before i try to use it once charged use your standard cable to your smartphone or tablet and charge away simply plug in your phone to the usb port hit the power switch and are charge the device has usb port on itone is a amp port for most phone and one is a amp port for feature press the power button twice and the device activate a small bright led flash i test this with phone to begin withmy power hungry iphone and my even more hungry samsung galaxy s it work great on both device i did also test with a ipad mini but my test was for a short time and thus i will not comment on it for my phone which see moderate daily use i achieve expect samsung device was down to about battery one afternoon after heavy usage and i want to make sure it had about at the bare minimum i plug it into this charger use the amp port and i was charge at the rate of approximate every minutes per hour theoretically you could plug the smartphone into the amp port and speed up charge but it is risky in that you would provide too much power to your phone and thus could hurt the battery personally i am satisfy with the charge rate on the amp port the iphone had similar result if not a tad fast in could be related to use the iphone seem to sip at battery power when charge where as the samsung use full power even while chargingone thing to watch out for when you put the battery pack in a bag make sure it is free of obstacle so that the power button do not get depressed while moving around this happen to me once but minor adjust in my storage of the device in my bag resolve the issuethi is a star item and respectful so love it and have no hesitation in recommend it
15) so simple yet so necessary love itthi is something we have need for a long time we have iphone s in our household and i insist that they all be protect with screen cover i was the install in the family and so i generally did a good i never did a great job as something was always off i usually could not align the protector to the home button or the speaker and camera i never heard the end of it this device is quite simplistic the plastic molding clip to your iphone on both then take a screen protector and continue to install it make sure you the screen to avoid bubble the molding acts as a guide so you install the protector at the right spotthe first time quick recommendation before you attach the molding use a piece or two of scotch tape and lift off any debris from the iphone screen just stick it on and off across the whole screen then use the included microfiber cloth to the screen further to remove oil and smudge then attach the molding and use the microfiber cloth once again to make sure you have not miss a i recommend you hold your iphone at a few angle to make sure there are no tiny dust pieces or fiber hanging around on the screen finally install your new protector and smooth it be bubble free and perfectly love this product and idea its a for mebut i do wish that price was a tad bit better
16) great idea but improvement is require do it work yesi it practical yes depend on your use casei dont think this will really fit your wallet if you are try to keep your wallet on the thin if you use a leather wallet like i do the sound is completely muffle and hard to hear that being said it will work great for item that you can attach it to such as backpack luggage do it work simply put this is a bluetooth device that you pair to your smartphone and then utilize an application that is available for it to make it use basically you must pair the trackr to your phone and use their application to find your lost article or its last known test a simplistic use case in and around my home i simply pair the device to my iphone s and downloade the trackr application once the application was launch on the phone the it show the trackr connected and i was able to send an alarm to it as well as use the built in gps functional of the app to find where the trackr was i then decided it was time to do a range test and left the trackr on our dine table while walking out to the expect the connection bluetooth connection between the trackr and the application was lost i then proceed to click on the locate trackr link in the application after which i was given a map with the last known location of the trackr now it was time for reverse put you can press the button on the trackr itself and it will sound an alarm on your iphone basically press and hold down the button on the trackr while you are walking around your home and if the trackr application is running on your iphone it will make a sound even when in silent is my one major negative the application basically has to be left running in the background on your phone in order for this device to stay connected via bluetooth if you quit the application then it will lose the connection to your phone and only have record the last location when it was while this will work if you are track an item that you had at one point and left somewhere ie key backpack luggage etcit is quite scary i mean if the app was running when i was in my office with the trackr attach to my backpack and then i proceed to quit the application and head to the library where i left my backpack the app would tell me that the backpack was still in my office last known location scary the wallet idea is the alarm functional would be somewhat inefficient in this scenario since the sound will be muffle when this is tuck inside of a wallet pocket it is also thick the gps functional may help you find your wallet location and that could be somewhat of a just hope you dont have to find out the hard knowing where it iswa then not knowing at allnow where it is useful is in certain around the home key yep we all misplace them and go nuts look for will help you know if one the key are actually in your home and two use the alarm when you get close to the trackr find them i can think of a few ways to use this at remote maybe too big to tape on back of one and other item you spend time look for i also think this would be a great addition to any luggage you have when you travel especially checked it to your suitcase launch the application and leave it running when you arrive at your destination and are wait for your luggage you can just bring the application to the foreground and wait for a connectiona sure sign your bag is around and will eventually make it around the belt so you can retrieve iti think it is a well price gadget that solve a problem that most of us have at one point or the otheri just think it needs a little more work in functional explanation of use etc"

2) best bluetooth speakerphone i have use i have been use this hand free bluetooth for a few week now have a newborn in the car i will not hold the cell phone up to my ear i will only use bluetooth have always been impress with jabra product i have one of their in ear bluetooth and it is the best one i have for block out noise and for voice clarity however when i received this i was certain it would not compare to supertooth light bluetooth speakerphone blackthat i have had for a few years i was convinced no other speakerphone was better for the car after all it sound great never received complaint and took it in the house to charge when that said i was interested to try this device thinking it would not compare to what i already had boy i was wrong first of all when you turn on the jabra the power button is on the side right away a lady voice states to turn your cell phone into discovery mode it states to enter the universal pin of but that was not need on my phone within seconds my cell phone was pair right away the device automatic download the phone book from your cell phone once this is done and you power it off then on the unit make a chime and states you are connected so you know you have a connection i believe you can turn off the blue light on the jabra to show it is connected however i like have it on it is not a distract while driving and is a solid light when you receive a call the voice states the number that is calling it is not hard to miss to accept the call simply hit the phone icon in the center speak as desire and you have the option to turn the volume up or down on the top left and right very simple but yet very nicely design i love how loud the call get and the clarity of the call and the voice built into the phone when your call is over simply hit the phone icon again when you power off the unit it states it is power off it is great since you probably will be in the car while use this and if you forget if you did an action on the phone you have the automate voice to let you know you to my blueant which i thought was the best one out there this one blow it out of the water the benefit over my blueant are as follow to turn the blueant on you would have to slide the microphone out and you would have to remember to slid it back in to power it off with the jabra if you forget to power it off it go into a standby mode the blueant has the annoy flash blue light to let you know you are connected when the blue light on the jabra is solid and not interference for me the blueant do not have the automate voice command letting you know you are connected if it is power on and off etc i find this so helpful with the jabra even though i know i have hit a button to hear a woman record voice telling me what action is taking place is wise it is perfect i debate whether or not i would like that the clip was built into the unit since my blueant has a magnet you place on the visor i find the jabra to be easy since it is all built in and prevent the device from get lost to the main unit unlike my bluetoothi cannot speak for the low battery indicator since it has not run low and i also bring it in the house to charge it through my usb port on my computer every night and like habit take it out to my car along with my cell phone now i will say my blueant do not have a low battery indicator so i have no idea when it is running in all the one i love blueant and thought i could not find a better speakerphone for my car this one has proven to be the best i have learned my blueant is really outdated or jabra is very advanced regardless jabra is my favorite and i did not think that was possible call wise i have had no complaint i use it a lot on the interstate with a newborn in the backseat and nobody has said they cannot hear me or any interference from the traffic it do have a small delay sometimes and get silent but that is worth it for the clarity this speakerphone the past i would not have bought a jabra speakerphone since i was so hooked on the blueant but after a bluetooth headset and now this top of the line speakerphone i think they are the brand i will be pick out in the future i like it so much i bought my elderly mother one since she transport my daughter and i did not want her fumble for the phone anymore especially with my daughter in the car i am very impress enough i got it for my mother and will recommend it to other

4) never knew how much i need it i have use a battery bank before but in today day and age it is so easy to plug device into our car and wall that we never really think we need them however i never knew how much this one was need until i had itwhen look around i was thinking of get one that was mah for about the same price however this one has mah and the dual portsit is a bit hefty weight but that is obvious because it is a power bank when i received it it was almost charged up but i plug it in to make sure the whole bank was charged there are blue circle on the outer front to let you know how much charge it has i had three when i went to charge it and then four solid circle once charged i was very impress with the quality of the device it is made very well i also like that you can use it as a flashlight push the power button twice and voila you have a flashlightthe other time i use my power bank another brand and did not hold much of a charge was when i lost power in my home a few years ago in the dead of winter it came in so handy i never knew how handy this device would come in or the timing of after charge it up and packing it all up in the nice little mesh blue bag that was included i found when this item became priceless i am one of those people who likes to be prepared but nothing prepared me for the time i was go to use this one night my father call and said he need to go to the emergency room i knew he has been in poor health i call my sister who lives near me up north and we took the trip down south to pick him up and get him to the er he has never been to an er he was a pilot so flying rely on his health being pass by a doctor so he was always fearful of them long story short this was not just a cut finger but they told us that night he was not go to live long running out of the house my sister and i both were use our cell phone to call family from the er my sister was get low and she joke that it would have been nice to remember to bring an extra charger but in the er room there was nowhere to plug it in anyway we were sitting there watch our father in so much pain but knew we need our phone i then remember i had that blue bag tuck away in my purse we were both able to charge up our phone since we both use the same adapter we were not able to use the dual part but both of our phone were juice my father was taken to a room upstairs to rest he had ask for his cell phone and kindle he lives with his kindle he said he did not know where the charger were for them though we both told him not to worry we would look for them we went to his house to retrieve the device and could not locate the charger still have everything in my bag meaning the power adapter as well i went back to his room that night and charged up the battery bank then with the adapter that were included i was able to charge both his phone and kindle at the same time by the time he woke up they were fully charged he was so happy since he knew he was go to be there for have to say the battery option came in so handy when we sat at his bedside with his lights off not able to see things i would use the flashlight on the bank it is not too bright but give off just enough light for you to see what you are doingi now keep this bank fully charged up and in my purse i literally did not know how handy it would come in and how much time and stress it would save us my sister has since bought one herself even with it being heavy i still take it with me in my purse because you just never know when you are go to need iti also would like to add i was provided this device in exchange for a review at the time i was offer another battery bank but ask if i could review this one instead and the company was very accommodating i look back and am so glad i was able to choose this one it literally was a lifesaver for us
5) fit my needs the case snap on quite easily yet has a tight fit and is very attractive there is no problem reach the control or charge the phone with the case on the back is sturdy and appear to be more durable than other case i have try the first thing i really like about it was how the case feel when i hold the phone it is smooth but not slippery i notice on the package that it has a soft touch double coat antislip finish and that describe it perfectlythe instruction were easy to follow to add information that make one find if an honest person find the phone and wants to return it there is space for much more information to be share but i just want the basic information to guide someone back to me in case i lose my phone i can see that a business person or someone who wants to be more would find the case even more use for share much more information than i do still it is an inexpensive kind of insurance for me if the phone is lost and someone do want to return it to mefor my use i can find nothing wrong with the case or missing that i would add as with most things one must decide if it fit your needs the best

2) where art thou nokia oh boy where do i start a review for this producti saw this product on sale at dell website and overly impress with the spec and the review on amazon almost immediately i ordered one for myself and just about to order another one for my wife i put it on hold till i try out one of them glad that i did not order the nd i did not like the idea of go for a data plan with att and being stuck to a service provider for long years and badly want to buy something with no data me break down each of the feature functional of this product in detail it is probably the most detailed review you will find on this product first the good part and then the bad a phone call full mark to nokia as a phone the phone has excellent signal reception compare to any of the smart phone out there in the market i have use a and nokia score above still camera is good for outdoors but very poor for indoors the photo look very grainy front camera is decent and you can use it to make video call with your friends running fring on their iphoneandroid and other video video quality is excellent i have shot a few video outdoors and almost compare to hd switch since the phone feature video still front rear camera switch from a video to still and back to video switch from front to rear camera and back is so difficult and nonintuitive i am a pretty good geek with stuff and i found it extremely difficult and confuse to switch between different memo can sync with exchange on your computer but cannot sync directly with exchange server unlike androidiphone which can directly connect to your company server which means everytime you need to connect the phone to the computer for music player output is very good lack a audio book player it do not playback divx movies sorry torrent folks youtube playback ok i thought i will be able to use this to play youtube video to entertain my daughter while driving we are driving i was not able to play even a single youtube video without pause and jerk made several attempt and finally gave on the forum and some suggest me to use the desktop version try it on wifi but even on wifi while it is better than gg it is still disgust playback speedi was very disappointed with this whole youtube playback access imagine that you open a mail and it come up as new mail image this phone do not even support html email no image either other than that the good part is that it do a pretty good job of sync with gmail yahoo and download the the keyboard was a bit impressive you have option mini keyboard full size keyboard or you can write in your handwriting i like to input text with the full size keyboard as this one was the most yes there is an app store but it the store is so poorly organized and very user unfriend that you would end up spend hour to find the right app for the app itself there are some decent app available for game and productivity but if you have use any androidiphone app you will realize that nokia is waaaaay to behind in the screen first of all this is a resist touch screen means you need to actually put pressure on the screen for it to work unlike the modern day capacitive touch screen which will only need you to just touch and the screen will pick up static charge from your the nokia resist touch screen works but it is very poor in response you will almost always need the accompany it do have a radio but it will not play unless you plug in the headset which acts as a antenna even after plug in the antenna it pick up a few strong signal but did not pick up some of the weak signal neither indoors nor i have a year old gps from garmin and i thought i will throw it out after i get a nokia oh oh big mistake the nokia phone come with a assist gps means it do with satellite as well as with cell phone the phone do a good job of finding your current location it is extremely poor in finding directions and reading out the street name and directions it works but it is no where near to a regular gps or a built in gps like the one in iphoneandroid summary honestly i have never felt this frustrate with any phone in my life when i really want to love this so where art thou come down from your ivory tour and give us a good phone we do not want to be stuck up in the vicious circle of att and apple we want unlock phone and we do not want to see crappy phone like this from you pls wake up
3) easy to pair fit well on ear and excellent sound quality this is my second bluetooth headset after the plantronic that i is the process of get your bluetooth headset and the mobile phone talk to each other this is how it works put your jabra in discover mode search for bluetooth device from your mobile phone the mobile phone discover your bluetooth device and then enter the password it is usually but check the manual for your unique they are pair you long need to keep pair them each time next time when you switch it on it automatic recognize the fitthi is the toughest part most of us are not use to wearing something on our ear and it may be difficult and make it selfconscious for the first week or so but after that it just go off and you will be able to comfortable fit the ear set in your ear i find that that the jabra is more easy to fit and do not fall of so easily compare to my qualitysound quality is excellent usually the mobile phone is in my car cup holder or my pocket or a nearby table in my home and it is excellent the sound fade off as you move more than away or if there is a wall in between

2) superb case great design and execution the quickflipcase is a perfect fit for my iphone in its sonix case the flap is just the right height to be easy to open and close but not get in the way when try to put the phone back in without look the magnetic holder are strong and may cause an issue with the compass calibration im not sure yetthe clip on the back is extremely well design slide onto your belt easily but doesnt slide offi also try the iphone with an apple bumper and it fit quality and finish are also excellent i have bought cheap holder from amazon and ebay you can get similar case for around three buck but they all have issue they fall apart quick are too tight or the wrong fit the clip bends or doesnt hold right the grantwood case is more expensive but do not have any of these problem its well worth the few extra buck
3) perfect for spotty coverage area as an iphone owner in the south san francisco bay area im unfortunately too well aware of att coverage issue there are three tough spot on my daily commute where my call get consistent drop and i barely get any signal at my house i was curious to find out if the wilson mobilepro would be able to help the short answer it do the job as long as you install it properlythe wilson mobilepro is design to improve coverage in your car or in your home compatible with major carrier but check compatibility before you purchasethe package contain everything you need to set it up at either location a magnetic antenna for outside of your vehicle a suction cup antenna mount for home use an adhesive mount to attach the device inside your vehicle a usbmini usb cord a cigarette power adapter for in car use and a usb power adapter for home use it also come with a convenient zipper pouch that hold all the the device in the car is extremely easy although you will need to plan ahead if you want to run the cable tidy you probably want to purchase a multiple cigarette lighter adapter to avoid hog up one of the few available connect im use usb power need to locate the box as close to your phone as possible a foot or less works best and the antenna as far away from the box as possible if the separation between antenna and box is insufficient the single light on the box glow orange instead of green it revert to green once the problem is antenna attach easily to the roof of your car with a strong magnet you run the cable into the car and connect it to the box the very simple instruction are easy to follow and most people should be able to install it in under minutesin the couple of week ive had to test the device i have notice a marked improvement over the quality of call and a dramatic reduction in drop call obviously it cant create signal where there is none but if there is the slightest signal you will be able to use itthere are very few area where i think this product can be improve one is the dual use although both use are support the mount and antenna are not design to make switch an easy daily task but apparently to save the manufacturer a sku it would be nice if it ship with two antenna two power cords and two dock station one for home and one for the limitation is the length of the cords supply although theyre sufficient for most sedan owner of large vehicle may need to purchase a long power cord or find an antenna with a long cordthe wilson mobilepro is a well design easy to install kit that works well if you live in a weak signal area and get drop call often its well worth a try it can also be quite useful to boost signal at a desk but be aware that its range is extremely product highly recommend

5) brilliant excellent audio quality the hbs is a stereo bluetooth headset with a unique design bluetooth headphone are a challenge for hardware designer because of the need to house the electronics and a big enough battery to supply decent autonomy and the need for a wire between the electronics and both is why so far there has only been two major designs on the market one is large overtheear pad connected with a headband or just a wire the other being earbud connected by a wire to a little box housing the electronics both designs have problem the former is usually uncomfortable and the earpad tend to have problem stay in place particularly when exercise the latter defeat the purpose of wireless headphone by still leave you to deal with a tangle mess of wiresthe hbs offer a novel approach to solve this problem the electronics and control are house in a circle clip that sit around your neck and the earbud are connected to it by a short wire that cant get tangle even better the earbud attach magnetic to the tip of the neckband when not in the hbs get top mark the usual control are very logically organized and easy to identify by touch even while running or exercise the power switch is a mechanical slide so there never any doubt whether your headphone is on or off charge is done via a standard microusb connectorthe features are what you expect from bluetooth stereo headphone bluetooth action button pick up an incoming call hang up initiate a red volume on the left hand side playpause previous and next on the right hand side everything works very reliable and just as you would expect i have been use these headphone for month with an iphone even better the battery life is phenomenal at least hour of music playback and the neckband vibrate when a call come in impossible to miss a call even in a noisy environment or while youre listen to music and a call come in press the call button to pick up the call and the music pause when you hang up the music terms of sound quality the hbs deliver as well these are not high quality audiophile headphone but they sound perfectly adequate and will be great to use at the gym while jog sound quality battery life reasonable price make the hbs an excellent value if youre only go to buy one set of bluetooth headphone i cant think of a better model to recommend and ive try them all
6) convenient mount accessory the belkin liveaction camera grip is a simple grip that attach to the iphone or s and provide two shutter buttons one for still shot and the other for video as well as a standard tripod thread you attach the grip to your iphone for the first time the phone automagic notify you that this accessory require the liveaction app and take you to the app store so you can download it the app is freethe liveaction app is pretty similar to the standard apple camera app the most noticeable difference is the addition of a delay shutter release button or seconds and the lack of hdr control the trigger button on the grip works great with the app unfortunately it only trigger the shutter in the liveaction app a significant standard thread mount is very convenient and work well with my the arms of the grip are and handle my favorite case amazon basics tpu without problem although theotterbox universal defend not fitpro very simple to use help you download the liveaction app compatible with most iphone case very thick one wont work app include timer feature fit well in hand of all size shutter button feel very natural tripod thread shutter button only works with belkin liveaction app no other camera app probably because of limitation of the ios api but its still disappointing not so necessary now that the volume button can be use as a shutter button in the apple camera app but it put a trigger button in a much more natural position the limitation of the shutter button to the belkin liveaction app significant limit its usefulness the universal thread mount and the compatibility with most case make the belkin grip a fairly useful little accessory for the casual photographer more convenient than even if you end up not always use the shutter button
7) state of the art the plantronic voyager pro hd is the latest iterate of the already successful voyager pro headset although it shares the design with a couple of early model it add significant features and improvement that make it one of the best headset available on the market todaythe boom microphone and ear rotate so that you can wear the headset on the left or right ear the four buttons are logically organized and very intuitive the power button at the base of the set the volume updown buttons at the top of the headset and the action button on the center of the you power on you immediately tell the difference a soft female voice states power on and then give you an estimate of the remain talk time another welcome improvement the headset detect when its on your ear if the phone ring and you put it on it pick up immediately if youre on a call and take it off it hang up also if youre not wearing it call will not be route to it finally it support adp audio stream so you can also listen to internet radio from your phonehow about call quality top notch all the caller i talk to could not believe i was on a bluetooth headset this is definitely a headset you can use time on a full battery average about hour charge and update are done through a standard microusb connect located at the base of the headsetthe plantronic web site offer extra application feature configuration and firmware upgrade unfortunately this is come on plantronic make an effort and support the headset come with voucher for a year membership with the superb vocalyst service a value this service is accessible via a on the headset action button a fully voice activate service you can have it read your email to you news stock quote very impressivethe only con i have for this headset lack of osx support no carry case this casei available separate the pretty box it come in is difficult to view of the amazing performance and features of this headset i feel a five star rating is fully highly recommend
8) amazing value and yes it works great in a convertible with the top down this inexpensive bluetooth headset is a fantastic value in terms of bluetooth functional its as standard as it get and if youve own a bluetooth headset before you will immediately know how to use this one once you locate the convenient placed control volume updown and the boom is flexible and just the right length to sit right next to your mouth the earpad is articulated and fold in the headband is adjust and pad so its comfortable to wear even for an extend length of volume and quality are perfect at both end the earpad is clear and sufficient loud and the microphone pick up your voice perfectly without any background noise even in a convertible with the top down at mph a spectacular feat for such an inexpensive devicei was very pleasant surprise to find out that instead of the usual proprietary charge connect found on inexpensive bluetooth product or the mini usb connect on slightly better one this headset is charged use the ubiquitous micro usb better it come with a standard usb to micro usb cable and both a car a wall adapter which give you maximum flexible for charge not that you have to recharge it that often mind you thanks to the amazing long battery lifeit hard to find any con for the p it would be nice if it could fold up better and came with a carry case but considering the quality of the product and its low price those are inconsequential issue the product itself is just about highly recommend
9) perfect fit for the iphone s i ordered this battery from seller fusion which offer a reasonable price and free fast shipping via the fulfill by amazon program the battery itself was a perfect substitute for the original failing battery in my year old iphone s which is now back to its normal self install the battery require a well as a tiny philip screwdriver its a little early to tell if the battery will last but so far week so good
10) the golden age of wire the mmt handset is comprise of two parts the handset itself and a base both are extremely well made and are coat with a high quality rubbery finish the base is weighted and features a groove to hold a tablet or phone at a slight anglethe coil handset cord plug into the left side of the base use a standard mm minijack hidden in the back of the base you will find two color code minijack and a button in the center of the base allow you to switch between the can also ignore the base altogether and plug the handset directly into your phone a recess button in the center of the handset let you pick up incoming call and hang upthe mmt do its job very well unfortunately im not quite sure its a job that needs do if you dont mind the impractical of a tether headset there are much more convenient and comfortable device available for less and there is also a plethora of good quality bluetooth headset to choose from unless i miss something this product however well made it may be seem to be a solution in search of a problem
11) convenient charger a little pricey this energize charger is very versatile and deliver enough current to charge an ipad this version come with a microusb cable suitable for charge most modern nonapple cell phone and various gadget but you can use a different usb cordthe fold prong and cable storage are very convenient to avoid clutter and minimize space in your gadget only give it stars because i think its a little pricey for a single outlet usb adapter when you can find small power strip with builtin dual usb outlet for less but if you only need a single usb outlet this is a convenient one and the charge indicator is a useful feature
12) easy to apply feel great to the touch perfectly clear i have had mixed success with screen protector most of them are impossible to apply without trap some air bubble create an ugly sloppy distract look they also have a different feel to the touch this is one of the very few i have ever use that glide as well as the original glass the film is fairly rigid which make apply it very easy just make sure you wash your hand clean the screen well a microfiber cloth and sticky clean tape are provided and youre done in no timeso far the best and easiest protection film ive ever try and its inexpensive highly recommend
13) snatch defeat off the jaws of success what they were thinking no wonder that after being first on the market and despite have unique benefit such as the magnet the powermat system is and get wipe out by the qi case is completely idiot it do not provide sufficient protection for the iphone the bottom bracket part is very fragile and get constant detached and the optional battery back is overprice and find it pretty gall that duracell didnt even think about providing a little lip on the case to protect the screen in case of a fall its all the more disappointing that the idea is great but the devil is in the detail and this case is an abysmal failure too bad it didnt need much to be the best case ever instead its just a dud pass
14) great but the apollo solar panel charger is a battery pack similar to many other on the market except that one of its side features a solar panel that allow it to rechargei purchase the mah model and while the number is mislead as other reviewer have pointed out it is unfortunately the way the industry has standardize its capacity claim so any vendor report the actual capacity would put themselves at a disadvantage bottom line a full apollo hold enough juice to recharge a smartphone several times and i was able to give my ipad a good halfcharge apollo features two usb outlet identify as tablet a output and cellphone a a single button display the battery charge status on a led bar turn the output on or turn the builtin flashlight on or off for a fast charge you can use the builtin microusb connect and plug the apollo into a usb port or charger use the supply usb to microusb cablethe biggest problem with the apollo is that the output of the solar panel is weak and it cant recharge the battery as fast as charge a smartphone will drain it that wont come as much of a surprise to anyone who has use solar panel before but other are bound to be disappointed set your expectations the reasonable price for this capacity the decent manufacture quality and the convenience of the builtin solar panel its an excellent value just keep in mind it take days to recharge the battery use the solar panel
15) dont buy this you are probably wonder why i recommend against buy this adapter while give it five its a good reliable device from a company that consistent deliver quality anker make a new better model thew port travel power adapter that barely more expensive and is considerably better not only is it capable of deliver more power and charge more device simultaneous but it also do not have specific high current port so you dont have to pick it up to figure out which connect to use to charge your ipad any of the five will work at full while its a good product i recommend you skip it and spend six buck more for the w port travel power adapter
16) sturdy small than i expect provide lot of power this anker power adapter is one of a new generation of high current usb power adapter capable of charge multiple demanding device like tablet simultaneouslythe two top port circle and label apple can charge two ipad a each and the two other port label android can charge two other device up to a each so that include any mobile phone or demanding deviceit is extremely compact and works well the only minor complaint i have is that the prong are not fold a shortcoming for a device advertise as a travel charger still considering its one of the few adapter capable of charge so many device at the same time i think it deserve its five stars i would be more than happy to pay a little more for the same device with fold prong
17) its a tele converter not a zoom good value for the price you get a lot for the price the box contain a standard mini tripod which can be use with any camera fitted with a tripod mount an adjust phone bracket that can be fitted to the tripod an iphone s case with a thread lens mount the x tele lens itself a soft fabric carry bag and a microfiber clean use the lens just put your iphone in the case and attach the tele lens presto your iphone now has an x tele lens unfortunately it isnt a zoom the focal length is not adjust hey what do you want for twelve must be careful to disable the flash as it is obscure by the lens and the reflection will ruin your pictures this tele converter is surprising useful and certainly something that the iphone budding photographer should not be without i just wish the case were a little better or that the lens mount would evolve into some sort of a standard it would be great to be able to have additional lens mount fitted into every caseif you ever want to take closeup with your iphone this inexpensive lens is just the ticket and at this price there no reason not to splurge a fun toy
18) the first battery pack to tame my ipad with lot to spare i travel a lot and keeping powerhungry device working during long international flight is always a challenge over the years i have purchase a wide variety of power pack which all did a reasonable job at keeping my phone charged the highest capacity one were even able to recharge the ipad almost fully however things got bad when i upgrade to the ipad which is an incredible energy hog so i was eager to see how the juicypack juicypack is a little big than a portable hard drive x x and hefty oz the case is made of black matte plastic with a white edge surround the top features two usb connect a and a a microusb connect for charge and a white led a power button on the right side turn on the power and toggle the very bright led finally a backlit lcd display in the front report usage and percentage of remain battery power the package contain the battery pack and a usb to microusb cable which can be use for charge the juicypack as well as power a devicei ran a test by first fully deplete the battery on my ipad i play movies until i got successive low battery warning left and then the ipad shut itself down and fully charge the then plug in the ipad into the high power charge port and wait until it report charge when it was done i was floor to find out that the juicypack report capacity remain look at the numbers the ipad battery capacity is close to mah and taking into account the necessary loss of power during conversion and charge its likely that is a little optimistic still the simple fact that the juicypack was able to give the ipad a full charge and have power left to spare is extremely impressive none of my other charger has been able to do that except the amazing but much more expensive a which is not yet available on the market anyway i bought mine by backing the kickstarter you will be able to find here and on ebay battery pack that advertise much higher capacity mah for a third of the price of this unit i urge you to pass up on these they do not deliver anywhere near the amount of power they advertise and do not massive amount of power on the go quality construction convenient numerical display of percentage of charge remain builtin charge is slow it can take up to hour if the battery is fully deplete heavy but it has to be to pack so much very impressive and capable battery one of the best out there the ipad test was enlighten if you travel with powerhungry device like tablet it belong in your gadget bag very highly recommend to all road warrior and was provided a free sample in exchange for a fair and unbiased review"

2) almost perfect best use with other earphone i once own a previous generation of this product but the bluetooth range was limited to about three feet and the stereo audio consistent cut out with my iphone so it was near forward to and jabra has manage a foot lineofsight bluetooth range and within short distance the audio never cut out power the device onoff is easy and straightforward just like change the volume or track and pause the audio my iphone also show the battery life of the device right on the screen the hour of musictalk time seem reasonable and i dock the product a star poor quality earphone included they didnt fit my ear well so i just decided to use my own earphone but you lose the necklace feature and the plastic clip substitute is of low quality i would like to assume that most folks are buy this product to use their own headphone a unique characteristic of this bluetooth receiver but its probably not the case i use some high end ultimate ear and found the quality to be pretty close to being plug in directly to my phone biggest annoyance was a hiss during quiet moments the fm radio is also just a worthless gimmick no idea what youre tune to nor was i ever to get a clear signal id want to listen to lastly the builtin microphone for call is only ok for indoor use when i was walking outside on a mildly windy day the other party had difficulty hearing mei have no issue with the verbal command announce by the device or its beep they seem pretty natural and not overly loud pair is dead simple the tag use a standard microusb charger for charge and a usb cable for computer connection and ac adapter are included a nice touch youll get a full charge in just a couple hour which is pretty impressive to meif you understand the limitation of the product and are look to use your own earphone this seem to be a pretty good choice
3) excellent sound quality for a medium size room bottom line the audio quality seem very good to excellent you do need to know where the microphone is it is label omnidirectional but my experience didnt seem to match that the other party occasional complain of not being able to hear me so well if i was on the opposite side of the speakerphone in any case the sound is far better than the builtin speakerphone on any smartphone or tablet and perhaps beat out many laptop speaker too ive also use thejabra speak wireless bluetooth speaker for softphone and mobile phone this model is very similar to the logitech and sound quality seem equally as goodit was easy to turn on and pair with an iphone via bluetooth i dont have an nfc capable device so was unable to test pair via that method there a built in usb cable so its always convenient for charge with the included charger or plug into a computer and take just a few hour its pretty easy to figure out how to use the volume and mute buttons but i would prefer if these were tactile buttons as its not often clear if pressing them is do anything or not the led are a bit over the top in my opinion nonetheless the volume get plenty loud for a conversation with multiple people in a medium size room the battery seem to last as describe the product use a proprietary recharge battery and include simple instruction how to dispose of this battery but advise it is not enough youll also find a standard mm headphone jack to listen to call that way though in most case your better off just plug your headphone into your original device this feature exist more if you are use it as a sound card hooked into a laptop via usb port inside the box is a quick start guide as well youll probably read this once and then youll never look at it again note this device is not meant for music so if youre look for an occasional speakerphone and mostly a music device look elsewhere there a small neoprene case as well if you are go to take this from meeting to jabra speak unit win for a lower price as of this writing and if price is a priority win the prize since features are roughly equal else the logitech unit is a fine choice for a mobile speakerphone if you have a preference towards this brand or some other design feature
4) tad expensive no clean cloth but get the job done there an old iphone s lay around at home so i thought id give these a try the last screen protector i bought from monoprice was so glossy it was like look into a mirror every time i was try to focus on something on my phone screenthese screen protector arrive in a small cardboard box frustration free package there no clean cloth included to clean your screen before putt it on i had some lay around but as soon as you open the box there a with a few brief steps on how to install which really arent need remove the adhesive backing and careful apply to the phone i was able to do so easily on the first try with minimal bubble and the best part no glare on the screen i think small bubble are a given with any screen protector you just have to live with itim knock one star off for the high price im sure these cost penny to manufacture and no inclusion of a cheap clean cloth but other than that they seem like a reasonable product"

2) lightweight and comfortable good sound too the main package was difficult to open but once i did the earphone easily were remove i start off reading the business card size instruction the diagram showing the buttons were so tiny it took me a few times to figure it out i suggest go right to the website for a better pdf version that is readable while reading the manual online i immediately plug in the headset to fully charge which took about hrs the plug is not even a foot long and i thought that was a way too small i have it hanging from my wall socket and it just reach the floor i know the product manufacturer often read these review and you guy really need to make that plug much long if your at work you have to crawl under your desk to find a plug and then possibly step on itnot odd thing is that jabra suggest for outdoor use is that you keep your phone on your arm use an armband and it also say not to put it in our pocket or on the left side of your body i know that bluetooth had foot radius so i dont understand why they suggest those things i use it at the gym before type this review and i had no problem with it in my pocket indoors or headset can also be use as a headset for phone call too which is nice because if your out and about or working out you dont have to stop what your do and grab your phone the small problem with this is that the microphone is on the side of both ear so you will find yourself speak loud to compensate im told that i sound a little low but that what will happen when the microphone is on the side of the ear not a deal breaker for me because im really use these just for the wireless music feature and the style of over the ear they look like most of the jabra style earphone which are comfortable and stay put in your ear they come with additional rubber earbud to custom your fitting i would have like to have the choice of colors of the wire and accent they come in yellow which for years has been the color signify sport style i would have like blue and im sure girl would like also claim up to hour of talk time hour of music time days of standby time from what i experienced its about right if not a just a little less i like that they have different led colors letting you know what the status is for various things happening they have green blue and red the instruction online give you specifics there is also voice announcement for a few things like low battery and etcthere also a free app that you can download which help you track your fitness but i havent test it out as for the sound i was happily surprise how clear it was this is my first pair of bluetooth headphone so i cant compare them to other but only to normal wire headphone there good bass and the overall stereo sound was nice they sure beat the oem earbud the iphone come with im use these with an iphone and it was super easy to pair and get working fast it will also work with an ipod touch and ipad they also claim that you can pair them with multiple device so when i finally get an ipad ill be use this featureoverall i like them and they are easy to wear especially during workout i do know that after easy workout when i get home i take a damp cloth and wipe the headphone off because ive sweated so much that they are wet from it and dont want them to sorry but its the truth
3) not as good as they look im compare these to the jabra sport which are way better in many ways in my opinion which ill explain these are hard to get into and over your ear the earbud do twist but its difficult to do unless you use both hand to get then hooked over your ear while simultaneous twist the bud into your ear the are flexible and you can do it with one hand much easierthe sf have a small connect wire which i like better than the jabra the reason is that when moving and twist your neck the jabra stick to your skin if your sweaty and the motorola do not pair on both was super simple but the buttons on the sf dont feel like they click or depress at all the power button is a small nub that i thought was a piece of plastic that wasnt file down during manufacture plus its on the left and the there buttons are on the right i like that the jabra has them all on one sidethe sound quality is a bit crisp and loud on the sfs but there isnt much bass so they sound more tinny the sound on the jabra has better bass and i much prefer them battery life on the jabra is about hrs and the sfs is around of continuous music i do like that the recharge cord is long on the sfs whereas the jabra its about inch i did notice that while the music is at one level if a message come in or an announcement from the internal female voice its double as loud and its not only startle but it hurt your ear jabra doesnt do that it stays at the volume level you have the sfs do go loud than the jabra though but that not a good thing to have ear bud sfs also come with a bunch of different rubber bud to custom your fit as well as let more ambient sound in or not it also come with a nice carry pouch to keep things in in my opinion id rather have better sound so my preference is with the jabra i wish there was a way to have a few things from the sf and a few from the jabra which would make them a near perfect set at least for me the jabra look more like apple earbud so there are no rubber bud to fit its also been my experience that the rubber bud that the sf have can get clog up after time if you dont keep them cleani overall feel that the jabra are easy to use and have a better bass sound and also are quick and easy to put on but battery life isnt great i really want to love the sfs but for me the design was more of a problem than the sound
4) great for the price and easy to apply i bought these not only because there are in the pack but also because some of the review that state no rainbow effect the protector is easy to apply but take your time to line it up right and do it slow you wont have any air bubble i had also picked up the m just in case these were no good but to my surprise they are i try the m first thinking well more expensive and the brand name would be best to start with but it was a disaster from the get go for various reason including rainbow lines that wouldnt rub out and no step instruction on the protector itself for what to peal natural view nv screen protector for iphone pack retail package clearalso you only get one for buck so its double the price for very happy with the tech armor one and have no complaint other than it hold finger print a bit more than expect but i keep the microfiber cloth in my pocket with the phone to wipe it down now and then
5) works great which the cord was a tad long just got a new iphone s and need a charger for my car i had the chance to try out this one and so far its great the plug part is small and doesnt obstruct anything in the car its coil up but i think its a little on the short side still my plug port is in the center arm rest console and i need just a little more to stretch if far enough to get it in a spot where i can put it near methere a blue led that show its plug in which is great i have a life proof case and if anyone out there has one you know that not every plug fit in these case because of their design this charger plug fit no problem so this is also a plusthi charger is apple licensed it had smart ic to prevent overcharge and it also charge ipod ipad but only the new one with the lighten connect"

3) id happily pay double for triple for this perfect iphone case this case is amazing it is the perfect case it has soft inside silicone wrap to cushion your phone and a hard outside shell that keeps the case solidi originally bought the verizon silicone case that was available for the iphone on launch day and it was a total joke you look at it sideways and it falls off or get stuck on something i almost drop the phone a dozen times just because of the case slip off or get stuck in my pocket it offer no protection at alli decided to try this incipio case and it is amazing i love how it has a very simple solid block look with a matte finish i was pleasant surprise at how easy it was to put on and take off and how perfectly the two pieces fit together it is not too thick like otterboxe but offer great protection the case has a lip that stand above the screen enough to protect it from flat drops but not too much to make it very thick it just feel solid and fit easily in my pocket now im not one to drop my electronics very often but i actually drop this once and the case took it like a champ this case just feel like such solid protection that i dont even worry about it at all the buttons are in all the right place and are easy to use i especially like how the bottom near the speaker and the port are three separate hole instead of one which give you a very secure tight feel to the bottom in fact the entire case just feel tight and looks greatin conclusion i will never buy another brand case again i paid for this case at the time but id happily pay double or triple that price now that i have use it highly recommend
4) a lifesaver for those of us with chronic dead electronics we have two young daughter they have completely taken over all of the portable electronics in our house if you are like us you probably always have something that is low on battery at all times a typical scenario in our house is someone pile the kid in the car to go to the store or the mall or out to eat or wherever and grab the ipod only to find them dead these are the only things that keep us sane so that is where a portable charge solution would be greati was provided a yubi power ypa mah power bank for test and review and was ask only to give my honest review so this is what i impression the product looks great i received a silver model and it has a very nice outer metal body with plastic end it looks and feel very solid in your hand it has one power button one led that lights in three colors a micro usb input for charge the power bank and a normal usb output for charge your electronics it is about the length of two c battery but not quite as thick and not very heavy at all it is very compact and sleek look it also came with a small inch micro to normal usb cable for charge the unit which is nice so you dont have another long cable lay around i doesnt have any kind of capacity gauge so you just have to have it charged up when you need itit came with some charge to it so i plug it into my computer and charged it until it was full the indicator light was red while it was charge and turn green when it was full it only took a few hour to top it off for the initial charge after it was full i did some testingtest i took my old rd gen ipod touch that had about battery left and start charge it the battery in the this old ipod model is small than current model so it should charge a little fast it is an old battery and isnt as strong as it use to be but it still last a while i checked it every minutes or so and got the following readingsstart point chargeafter minutes chargeafter minutes chargeafter minutes chargeafter minutes i mention before the old battery in this ipod isnt that great so the may not be perfect but the important thing is it quick gave the small battery on my old ipod a use charge the following test with an iphone have much more consistent i plug in the power bank into my computer to charge it again and it was fully charged in the morning and ready to go took the fully charged power bank and plug in my mostly deplete iphone that had only charge remain i got the following readingsstart point chargeafter minutes chargeafter minutes chargeafter minutes chargeafter minutes full chargeoverall great result it was average about per minute which seem pretty good for a amp charger the power bank had plenty of juice to fully charge a pretty low iphone without any we took the discharge rd gen ipod touch and threw it in my wife purse with the power bank and checked it when we got to our destination where we would need an ipod to keep our daughter occupy it had increase the battery level to around in about minutes which gave us enough power to survive the trip it charged the ipod touch quick and the power bank gave off very little heat if any in the purse i can see this scenario happening several times a at work we are not allow to plug in any electronics into the usb port of our work computer that leaves me with the only option of climb under the desk with a charger block to charge my phone at work not really the best option while im at work my phone sit on my desk receiving email and text and i occasional use it for web browse app or remote access use there is no wifi available and the lte really eats up the battery fast i decided to plug in my phone to the power block while it was sitting on my desk and it successful kept my phone fully charged all day it was great i had a full battery at the end of the day it is a great option for charge your phone when you dont have a power plug overall the yubi power ypa mah power bank work great during my initial test and usage the product is compact and easy to use it looks and feel like a high quality piece of equipment the current price of is competitive with the other power bank of this size that are available on amazon but the yubi power product looks like it is built a lot better than its competition i can see this as an excellent option for a long plane trip or other travel where you do not have access to a power plug my biggest problem is go to be try to get this thing back from my wife i will probably have to get a second one highly recommend

2) nice look case this was a very nice look case while i had it unfortunately my phone fell into the pool and fry itself it take some get use to have the cover flip down and have to hold it out of the way for taking a picture also the screen onoff and volume buttons are hard to push with out long fingernail on the plus side it looks great and is very easy to remove for place the phone in a dock"

2) excellent better than expect i have to admit to being pretty thrill with this product and i was quite skeptical i have never use a screen protector on any phone ive own but the moto x is the first ive use that has the glass as the very material place it facedown means possible scratch as i learned the hard way motorola helpful replace the phone at no charge motomaker guarantee on the gorilla but i dont want to replace again so time for a screen protector this was one that was recommend on the moto x group on g some suggest a different round edge brand which is x as expensive but i went with this one because i wasnt sure id even keep ithave had it on for over a week now im sold a cinch to install not a single bubble and it is at least as smooth to the touch as the original glass i hardly know its there the edge of the protector feel round enough for mei will say that it isnt an absolutely perfect fit i line mine up at the bottom of the screen when i applied it the top edge do not match the slight curve of the phone as exactly as it could if that is a major concern for you this model might disappoint thus far no scratch on the protector but if they ever do show up i can replace it with way less hassle than a full phone replacement well worth the i paid via i change my mind at all due to problem with this protector this review will be july still working well there are a now couple mm scratch on the protector which presumable would have been on the phone screen itself they are not noticeable unless i look for them likewise the slight misalignment in the cut of the protector border it has become far less evident with daily use the protector is do a great job no change to the review above"

3) id happily pay double for triple for this perfect iphone case this case is amazing it is the perfect case it has soft inside silicone wrap to cushion your phone and a hard outside shell that keeps the case solidi originally bought the verizon silicone case that was available for the iphone on launch day and it was a total joke you look at it sideways and it falls off or get stuck on something i almost drop the phone a dozen times just because of the case slip off or get stuck in my pocket it offer no protection at alli decided to try this incipio case and it is amazing i love how it has a very simple solid block look with a matte finish i was pleasant surprise at how easy it was to put on and take off and how perfectly the two pieces fit together it is not too thick like otterboxe but offer great protection the case has a lip that stand above the screen enough to protect it from flat drops but not too much to make it very thick it just feel solid and fit easily in my pocket now im not one to drop my electronics very often but i actually drop this once and the case took it like a champ this case just feel like such solid protection that i dont even worry about it at all the buttons are in all the right place and are easy to use i especially like how the bottom near the speaker and the port are three separate hole instead of one which give you a very secure tight feel to the bottom in fact the entire case just feel tight and looks greatin conclusion i will never buy another brand case again i paid for this case at the time but id happily pay double or triple that price now that i have use it highly recommend
4) a lifesaver for those of us with chronic dead electronics we have two young daughter they have completely taken over all of the portable electronics in our house if you are like us you probably always have something that is low on battery at all times a typical scenario in our house is someone pile the kid in the car to go to the store or the mall or out to eat or wherever and grab the ipod only to find them dead these are the only things that keep us sane so that is where a portable charge solution would be greati was provided a yubi power ypa mah power bank for test and review and was ask only to give my honest review so this is what i impression the product looks great i received a silver model and it has a very nice outer metal body with plastic end it looks and feel very solid in your hand it has one power button one led that lights in three colors a micro usb input for charge the power bank and a normal usb output for charge your electronics it is about the length of two c battery but not quite as thick and not very heavy at all it is very compact and sleek look it also came with a small inch micro to normal usb cable for charge the unit which is nice so you dont have another long cable lay around i doesnt have any kind of capacity gauge so you just have to have it charged up when you need itit came with some charge to it so i plug it into my computer and charged it until it was full the indicator light was red while it was charge and turn green when it was full it only took a few hour to top it off for the initial charge after it was full i did some testingtest i took my old rd gen ipod touch that had about battery left and start charge it the battery in the this old ipod model is small than current model so it should charge a little fast it is an old battery and isnt as strong as it use to be but it still last a while i checked it every minutes or so and got the following readingsstart point chargeafter minutes chargeafter minutes chargeafter minutes chargeafter minutes i mention before the old battery in this ipod isnt that great so the may not be perfect but the important thing is it quick gave the small battery on my old ipod a use charge the following test with an iphone have much more consistent i plug in the power bank into my computer to charge it again and it was fully charged in the morning and ready to go took the fully charged power bank and plug in my mostly deplete iphone that had only charge remain i got the following readingsstart point chargeafter minutes chargeafter minutes chargeafter minutes chargeafter minutes full chargeoverall great result it was average about per minute which seem pretty good for a amp charger the power bank had plenty of juice to fully charge a pretty low iphone without any we took the discharge rd gen ipod touch and threw it in my wife purse with the power bank and checked it when we got to our destination where we would need an ipod to keep our daughter occupy it had increase the battery level to around in about minutes which gave us enough power to survive the trip it charged the ipod touch quick and the power bank gave off very little heat if any in the purse i can see this scenario happening several times a at work we are not allow to plug in any electronics into the usb port of our work computer that leaves me with the only option of climb under the desk with a charger block to charge my phone at work not really the best option while im at work my phone sit on my desk receiving email and text and i occasional use it for web browse app or remote access use there is no wifi available and the lte really eats up the battery fast i decided to plug in my phone to the power block while it was sitting on my desk and it successful kept my phone fully charged all day it was great i had a full battery at the end of the day it is a great option for charge your phone when you dont have a power plug overall the yubi power ypa mah power bank work great during my initial test and usage the product is compact and easy to use it looks and feel like a high quality piece of equipment the current price of is competitive with the other power bank of this size that are available on amazon but the yubi power product looks like it is built a lot better than its competition i can see this as an excellent option for a long plane trip or other travel where you do not have access to a power plug my biggest problem is go to be try to get this thing back from my wife i will probably have to get a second one highly recommend

4) a lifesaver for those of us with chronic dead electronics we have two young daughter they have completely taken over all of the portable electronics in our house if you are like us you probably always have something that is low on battery at all times a typical scenario in our house is someone pile the kid in the car to go to the store or the mall or out to eat or wherever and grab the ipod only to find them dead these are the only things that keep us sane so that is where a portable charge solution would be greati was provided a yubi power ypa mah power bank for test and review and was ask only to give my honest review so this is what i impression the product looks great i received a silver model and it has a very nice outer metal body with plastic end it looks and feel very solid in your hand it has one power button one led that lights in three colors a micro usb input for charge the power bank and a normal usb output for charge your electronics it is about the length of two c battery but not quite as thick and not very heavy at all it is very compact and sleek look it also came with a small inch micro to normal usb cable for charge the unit which is nice so you dont have another long cable lay around i doesnt have any kind of capacity gauge so you just have to have it charged up when you need itit came with some charge to it so i plug it into my computer and charged it until it was full the indicator light was red while it was charge and turn green when it was full it only took a few hour to top it off for the initial charge after it was full i did some testingtest i took my old rd gen ipod touch that had about battery left and start charge it the battery in the this old ipod model is small than current model so it should charge a little fast it is an old battery and isnt as strong as it use to be but it still last a while i checked it every minutes or so and got the following readingsstart point chargeafter minutes chargeafter minutes chargeafter minutes chargeafter minutes i mention before the old battery in this ipod isnt that great so the may not be perfect but the important thing is it quick gave the small battery on my old ipod a use charge the following test with an iphone have much more consistent i plug in the power bank into my computer to charge it again and it was fully charged in the morning and ready to go took the fully charged power bank and plug in my mostly deplete iphone that had only charge remain i got the following readingsstart point chargeafter minutes chargeafter minutes chargeafter minutes chargeafter minutes full chargeoverall great result it was average about per minute which seem pretty good for a amp charger the power bank had plenty of juice to fully charge a pretty low iphone without any we took the discharge rd gen ipod touch and threw it in my wife purse with the power bank and checked it when we got to our destination where we would need an ipod to keep our daughter occupy it had increase the battery level to around in about minutes which gave us enough power to survive the trip it charged the ipod touch quick and the power bank gave off very little heat if any in the purse i can see this scenario happening several times a at work we are not allow to plug in any electronics into the usb port of our work computer that leaves me with the only option of climb under the desk with a charger block to charge my phone at work not really the best option while im at work my phone sit on my desk receiving email and text and i occasional use it for web browse app or remote access use there is no wifi available and the lte really eats up the battery fast i decided to plug in my phone to the power block while it was sitting on my desk and it successful kept my phone fully charged all day it was great i had a full battery at the end of the day it is a great option for charge your phone when you dont have a power plug overall the yubi power ypa mah power bank work great during my initial test and usage the product is compact and easy to use it looks and feel like a high quality piece of equipment the current price of is competitive with the other power bank of this size that are available on amazon but the yubi power product looks like it is built a lot better than its competition i can see this as an excellent option for a long plane trip or other travel where you do not have access to a power plug my biggest problem is go to be try to get this thing back from my wife i will probably have to get a second one highly recommend

4) compact port usb wall charger adapter this little device connect to an ac wall outlet and provide usb port for you to connect any compatible device so you can charge multiple device through a single ac outlet the wall plugin prong on this charger fold in so you can more easily store it when its not in use it has builtin safety features so it wont overcharge your device this is another quality oxa device to use with a variety of mobile electronic item"

32) best car mount style ever ive try many other car phone mount this style is my favorite for many reason but the biggest reason is that you dont have to battle to get your phone release quick most phone mount have a spring loaded set of grip that hold the side of the phone this do as well but it release with a quick squeeze of the two side buttons which open up the two side grip they remain open until you put your phone back in and push the button seen inside the red circle which trigger it to clamp the two side phone mount has a sticky suction bottom and an additional clip to create a more secure suction on a window or dash even if it is a little bumpy the mount is completely adjust front and back side to side and the bottom of the phone rest can be lower or raise the mount has soft pad area clearly visible in red to keep your phone from get scratch the only issue is that the side grip are a little shallow my droid incredible g with a gel case fit well but the side clip are just at the edge of the phone and dont actually surround it if you have a fairly thick phone it may not work as welli highly recommend this phone mount and style it is well made easy to use

31) large clear took a little figure out this is not your average cube speaker it is large about inch square if you think that is small get a ruler and draw a inch square and figure on it being that tall as wellhowever what you give up in a small footprint you gain in sound and volume it has great sound deep clear crisp vocal great for music podcast stream radio or whatever it has a large face with onscreen touch control volume forward backward mode selection and pause it also display what the input is blue line or radio and it announce in a unique voice when it go into or out of bluetooth modei havent try it as a phone speaker but i tend not to want to use a bluetooth speaker for phone use too many people in the house listen thenit take a little finagl to figure out how to use it but really it become pretty self explanatory after some use it come with a usb to micro usb cable for charge and it also has a usb port on top which allow you to power or charge a phone or other device while it is running it come with an audio cable for device that dont have bluetooth you can also use a micro sd card in a port on top to play music from if you dont have it on a phone or other deviceit say it is natural wood design but im just not sure what they are refer to there is no obvious wood in the exterior of this speakerso there is some great sound great volume and many option for usei was provided a unit for evaluate and review
32) best car mount style ever ive try many other car phone mount this style is my favorite for many reason but the biggest reason is that you dont have to battle to get your phone release quick most phone mount have a spring loaded set of grip that hold the side of the phone this do as well but it release with a quick squeeze of the two side buttons which open up the two side grip they remain open until you put your phone back in and push the button seen inside the red circle which trigger it to clamp the two side phone mount has a sticky suction bottom and an additional clip to create a more secure suction on a window or dash even if it is a little bumpy the mount is completely adjust front and back side to side and the bottom of the phone rest can be lower or raise the mount has soft pad area clearly visible in red to keep your phone from get scratch the only issue is that the side grip are a little shallow my droid incredible g with a gel case fit well but the side clip are just at the edge of the phone and dont actually surround it if you have a fairly thick phone it may not work as welli highly recommend this phone mount and style it is well made easy to use
33) sleek and fun to hold solid performance this little powerbank has a nice feel it seem to be made of great material solid construction and feel good in your hand which is good because it is a great little flashlight as well it hold enough for one to two full charge and a few partial charge of a smartphone or a single charge to a small tabletit come with a usb cable and a mini usb and micro usb tip although you can also use your own usb cable it has a four light indicator to show the remain level of powerthi is a very nice small capacity powerbank at a great pricei was provided a unit for test and review

35) works well leaves fingerprint im a little torn about this keyboard and case the case fit nicely minimal protection and the keyboard add a small amount of bulk to the back and is magnetize to stay put the keyboard looks nice and hook up via bluetooth easily but for me i found that use this keyboard was more of pain than just use the on screen keyboard and it has a shiny metal surface so fingerprint show up if you are use to a slide out keyboard on your phone or a blackberry this could be a great product for you since it do just what it is supposed toi was provided a sample to test and review

40) nice speaker with fm radio as well this was easy to charge and quick to pair being water resistant give it an advantage over many other speaker im just not sure how many times i want a bluetooth speaker in my shower to listen to music but catching up on the news via the radio is a great option i certainly dont want to answer a call in the shower as a bluetooth if you want something near a tub hot tub pool or even out in the rain this could be the sound is pretty good not as great as other speaker in this price range but maybe you give up a little bit of sound for the water proof feature it has on board control for power forward back pause and call answer the outside is a silicone rubber with port seal off i havent try it submerse in water but it do repel small has a suction cup on the back for mount on a smooth surface the fm radio was surprising loud and for many station clear it didnt pick up on my favorite and it is difficult to know which station it is actually on since there is no display but once you find yours just keep it therei was provided a sample for test and review
41) compact works well this is a small but solid built two usb wall plug what i like about it is not only tiny but the prong fold in for storage it has smooth round edge as well so toss around a purse or briefcase and it wont scratch other thingsit work well for charge most of my device it did my samsung galaxy s phone kindle fire another regular phone and speaker it did not charge my samsung galaxy note tablet but that is not unusual it is pretty proprietary in the and nicely built a good product at a good price i was provided a unit for test and review"

2) good case this is a classy look case and offer some protection as well it doesnt cover the phone entire though so if that what youre after then i suggest otterbox what i like is that you can replace your wallet for a night out if you want to lighten the load on the pocket and it looks good at that depend on what screen protector you buy there is a caveat the plastic inside the flip cover tend to stick to mine mesh would have been better inside for my taste the part that you actually put your phone in is also grabby if you have body protection which i do one star of for those two caveat theyre not deal breaker though and its still worth purchase
3) pretty good the cable and end dont feel the same quality as the oem cable that come with the note but they get the job done and allow the flexible of keeping the tablet charge while reading etc you dont need to be rooted to the power outlet"

2) looks good sound only ok they works great and are good for making phone call but for listen to music they are not the best choice they sound flat and lack bass the material of the cable seem to prevent tangle a little they stay untangle more than other one i have use beforei would not hesitate to buy them again as my main use is phone call and if that what you intend to use them for they do a good job for music fan i would suggest look for something else
3) give your phone the stamina you always want this battery is a monster in a good way yes it add significant weight and size but what you get is truly impressive in terms of usage time this battery doesnt make your phone work long it will make your phone go the entire day with plenty of use this is what i always want i want my phone to make it through an entire day no matter how much i use it and not have to worry about running out of battery this battery finally meet that needthe caseback that come with it and replace the original one is made of a semi flexible material at first i was skeptical it might not be solid enough but it turn out it works great it do flex a little but it seem to hold the massive batter very well in charge the phone with the large battery doesnt take that much long it has almost times the capacity of the original battery so i expect charge to also take that much long but it doesnt seem to looks like the phone know about the large battery and allow for a higher current definitely a positive thingthe battery gauge works perfect with this battery it show the percentage correct so there are no very happy with this battery the increase size and weight are fine with me for get a phone that give me absolute peach of mind about lasting through the day
4) dont get too excited the replacement glass is fine the sticky tape the sheet that looks blue is great but that where it end the supply tool are completely useless for the task of replace the glass on a galaxy s iii none of them do the other have pointed out the success of replace the glass depend highly on knowing how to do it i have replace the glass of other phone but unfortunately fail with this is not just tricky to do it is actually very difficult and chance that you wont succeed are high the glass and the digitize are glue together and need to be separate this is extremely difficult as you have to heat the glass up to soften the glue but at the same time too much temperature will damage the display as i said none of the supply tool do the job and try to use them will lead to have to lift the glass up just a tad and then drive a thin blade through the glue layer to separate glass and digitize if you do it at the wrong angle you will scratch it or even cut itwhen watch the tutorial video keep in mind that these guy have done this many times and still gave it a star because the product itself is fine except for the useless tool just keep in mind that do the replacement yourself is really difficult

4) chunky but protective this case fit very tight over the s in fact it fit so tight that it is extremely hard to remove i think that is a good thing because then it is unlikely to fall apart if you drop it i feel very comfortable with my phone in this case it doesnt have anything over the screen but the glass on the phone is very port are all accessible without any flap this means that you dont have quite the protection in the rain that you would with an otterbox but it is nice that you can get to them i plug in a headphone jack with a degree connect and had no problem the micro usb cable just fit into the charge port but that go along with how everything in this case can be call tighti would not call the case particularly attractive but i had the blackgrey for review the shape is interesting in that the bottom of the case is slightly wide than the top so that you end up with a d trapezoid the back is a slick plastic so you need to be careful when holding the case there is rubber for the power and volume buttons but they dont help much when gripping they dont require much pressure to operate though so that nice there is some rubber around the face of the phone but it doesnt touch the table if you put the phone facedown in other words this turn your phone into something of a hockey do like how my phone only come into contact with soft rubber i am confident that this case would protect my phone if i drop it less than the feet this case is rate to withstand the only negative to the rubber is that it make a strange muffle sound when the phone if im go to take on the bulk of a protective case i would probably go with the otterbox defend because i prefer the shape and the friction of the rubber however if you want something that will easily slide in and out of your pocket the pelican is a fine choice"

2) you cant ask for much more from a bluetooth headset i use this with a samsung rugged phone for when driving and i have few to no complaintsi do use the ear loop as i have never been able to find an inear piece that fit my ear canal but that is no problem i had hope that this would work as an inear unit since it was so light i thought i wouldnt have any problem but no luck for methe thing that always concern me is sound quality when it come to bluetooth headset i realize that some of the sound quality issue has to do with the phone but most has to deal with the headset i have had an excellent experience with this headset as far as what i hear on my end it is great the volume can be raise to a loud enough level that i can hear well when i am in a loud vehicle cab i really do notice the noise cancellation technology making a difference compare to other headset i have use i hear people very clearly in often noisy environmentsthe only drawback is that sometimes people say i am hard to hear or that i sound distant i have try repositione things to make it better but it appear to be hit or miss sometimes people can hear me clearly other times is sound very distant my only course the unit is easy to use flip open to turn on flip close to turn off the talk button is a little flimsy to use and hard to press down but the headset do allow for voice activate for answer call so that is what i use most of the timebattery life is extremely good i can almost go a week with use the unit while driving and not need to rechargei can speak much to the roam distance since i am often not much farther than feet from my phoneso all in all i do recommend this unit i would give stars but the audio quality problem on the other end of the line cost one you have any question i would be happy to answer since i use the unit daily just leave a comment and i will try to get back to you"

2) good in a way but bad in a way ok if you really want a mirror screen on your ipod this is it it really do look like a mirror while the screen on the device is off now turn the screen back on and the mirror is gone you can now enjoy all your cool app well maybe not so much since the screen do give you that mirror like effect it doesnt completely go away when the screen is on it give it this weird type of effect similar to watch a d screen without the glasses it do not distort the image however its just a weird type of effect also it make the colors a little off to be honest i could not stand look at the screen for more than five minutes lucky i install the mirror screen on my son ipod and he love it he doesnt seem to have a problem with it like i did so i guess this just means im get cannot give it a total bad rating since it do turn your screen into a mirror screen just like promise but i also cannot give it a perfect score because it took away from the ipod experience in my opinion by remove some of the color of the beautiful screeni hope this review help
3) perfect almost i love it when product do just what theyre supposed to do this screen protector do exactly that it protect your screen from scratch and it do reduce smudge the only problem that i have with this screen protector is that it make the screen look a little dull its not so bad as for me wanting to take it off but it do remove some of the clarity and bright of the deviceoverall this is a good product i think its a bit pricey at a piece but it do what its supposed to do
4) definitely recommend it after test this new jabra supreme bluetooth headset i can say that this a solid bluetooth headset easy to use not too bulky good look and what more important it has great audio quality battery is great as well ive been use it for two days straight without have to recharge itit only take a couple of minutes to sync this headset to your phone and youre set to go easy and simple just for test purpose i try the nano bluetooth adapter on my laptop and it works great its extra slim too so it will not add a mayor bulk to the side of your laptop if that is what you intent to use it for i also had my son try it on the playstation he said it was as easy to connect as any other bluetooth device and that the audio quality was great as welloverall i am very pleased with this headset jabra has a winner here i definitely recommend it
5) the best case ive ever own this case is the best case ive ever own after purchase this case i bought one more for a coworker as a christmas gift and one for my wife its just an awesome durable case that really protect your phone my coworker drop her phone a few days ago and she thank me for give her the case both the case and the phone were damage freei had a problem with a mac case which made button press super hard this case actually make the volume buttons and the onoff button much easy than use the phone alone its just perfect trust me you buy this case youll probably end up recommend iti highly recommend this one more thing the case is a little hard to install and uninstall but not impossible but then again once its one why would you want to take it off and risk damage to your phone
6) not up to jabra standard ive had my fair share of jabra product and i have always been happy with the quality and performance until i got my hand on the stone this is seriously not up to the jabra standard that ive grown accustomed tothe most important aspect of any bluetooth headset device is sound quality sadly the stone do not meet my expectations sound quality is mediocre at best battery life is even sad i mean this is the first time that my bluetooth device battery die before my phone is very awesome i give you that it fit comfortable around the ear i hope that jabra can match the style with quality on their next project
7) good but restricted to work great let me start of by saying that the product is of great quality and it will probably work with most people and car however i found a mayor flaw in the rotate system that will only allow you to bring the phone down to a certain degree you can move sideways as much as need you can also move up as much as it is need to be adjust but you cannot move it down too far because the design block you this means that you will not be able to adjust it in any part of your car if the dashboard is too high or if you happen to be on the short side since you will not have the phone facing directly at is great and the suction cup is super strong and secure while still being able to easily remove and install again i really want to love this product unfortunately it was a no for me as i felt very limited to adjust it the way i want it which was on the high side of my toyota sienna dashboard i end up remove it and install it on my desk as a phone holder it works great there for menote to the designer of this mount next time make the rotate head free to move all the way down in order to accommodate all car and preference"

2) wellconstructe charger but not much power original reviewwhat can i say about this one it do the job deliver a steady and consistent amount of power to recharge my motorola razr phone and appear to be and more durable than the nonoem charger for sale here on amazon and elsewhere ive gone through a couple of offbrand charger that seem to break after a year of use that cost a few buck more than this one if you are look for a good charger for your phone or anything else that charge via a microusb like my kindle fire i would recommend this one updatethe above review was written after use the charger for about two week after a long period of time while my comment on the durable construction of the charger remain valid the power output is pretty minimal and i am change my rating from a star to a star charge my motorola phone take a heck of a long time if the power level is less than and for example when it to and plug in during a twohour drive it consistent never get above charged
3) easy to install and good job the review of this thing are all over the place in my case it was very easy to apply this to my droid it looks good fit snug and do the job compare to the one it replace ths one make my phone look brand new again
4) easy to install and do the job overall this cover do what it is supposed to do it protect your ipod screen and reduce the glare in my case it help stop a lot of the smudgy fingerprint this one was not too hard to line up and put on you install it on your ipod let me point out a couple of things clean your ipod screen with the soft cloth that come with the screen protector do not use water to assist you but use a gentle wipe motion with the cloth why you dont want to put the cover over a bunch of fingerprint and have your fingerprint memorial on your ipod make sure you use the that come with it or a credit card to help smooth out the bubble be patient line it up and go slow this cover doesnt have much to be slightly off if you go just a fraction at an angle to one side you will start covering the ipod edge case vs the screen if that happen slow back it up and start againoverall this is not too bad and do what it is supposed to do and i think you would rather have a screen protector vs a scratch up ipod
5) durable charger this is my second powergen dual port car charger to own unfortunately i lost my first one in a rental car and it do the job well deliver a steady and consistent amount of power to recharge my phone and my kindle fire at the same time and appear to be and more durable than most of the nonoem charger for sale here on amazon and elsewhere if you are look for a good dual charger for your device that charge via a microusb i would recommend this one"

6) works well for phone convenient but not strong enough for an ipad i have a of micro usb device and this is great for a quick charge in an urgent charged my htc evo and blackberry bold but barely got of the way on my to carry in your computer bag or car for an urgent situation where you cant get to a power outlet
7) great case sleek durable and seem to protect pretty well i really like the sleek of this case the metallic back and the fact it still has rubber guard around the edge that provide drop and bump protection i use a screen protector and feel good to thing i dont like are the custom color buttons for your activate button siri go on in my pocket constant and i had to remove iti had a otterbox defend and it almost double the size of the phone got sick of how bulky it was and am very happy with this
8) works ok we have not found this to be much increment beneficial for us it do not seem to pick up very many channel and has been very glitchy overall havent found a clear reason for this device
9) so close to perfect in terms of a bluetooth so close to perfect this stays on the ear has decent incoming sound how you hear other but the microphone doesnt quite pick up your voice as well as i wish it couldi had a plantronic voyager pro that fell apart and several plantronic user were praise mpow so i gave this a try i have to say the voyager pro is a better headset particularly for outgoing sound quality also small complaint but incoming sound is a little than if like especially when i am walking outside even when it is prefer the original voyager pro caution that the more recent voyager arent as good and the legend has a proprietary charger vs on ear unlike so many other to pair and connect multiple phone a must for well in ear caution to pick the right of the three provided ear incoming sound but a little usb charge means your current set of cords will probably workthe plastic shell definitely seem more durable than that found on the plantronic negative is that the outgoing sound quality is mediocre at best base on what other tell me they i could turn the volume up on other a bit moreoverall a moderate recommendation
10) like the extend battery case wish button access and headset jack easy to use ill admit up front i had mixed feelings on get this overall i like it much better than i it has more than double battery life a good overall case provide good i would change volume and power buttons are hard to access wish the buttons were not quite as recess headset jack require i recommend this"

2) good sound quality easy onoff super tiny in your pocket i have been told this bluetooth headset sound best among the one i have or one i lost motorola claim this one has extra long range perhaps in close proximity this means strong signal anyhow i am happy on that thing that i love about this headset is how compact it fold when not in use it is the smallest i have when fully fold it is off the ear loop is also ambidextrous and easy to flip around for left or right ear no need to snap it off first like with other headset ive had it will fit in any tiny shirt or pant pocket or corner very headset is very easy to pair although they are all get much better these days in addition it tell you hour of talk time remain and so on every time you turn it on this is all good but i notice that without much talk it start saying hour and then so perhaps this battery indication is not the most reliable my only issue with this headset is that after prolonged use just keeping it on my ear my ear start to itch the strange thing is that it itch in the ear canal and this headset has nothing that protrude in there maybe it is just me or maybe there is something to this headset that could irritate the skin this is not a big deal for me because i normally fold the headset off when not expect a

2) simple to pair easy to operate this is a good headset the htxt universal bluetooth headset retail in an attractive hard plastic box which im use for storage of some little bit which made me happy than have another package to recycle the headset is compact and different than my other bluetooth headset because the boom is fold the most difficult part of get this up and running was remove the little plastic from the headset so id give it tom mark for accessible and function easy to charge this headset hasnt burn the charge any fast than my other headset another plus pair with a motorola razr was simple and require nothing other than turning on both unit yay for ease ill admit that i was startle because a voice spoke to me as soon as i open the box but i wasnt too surprise since the light was already on in the headset ive had no problem with the fit in my ear or the reception but i usually travel too far from my phone so it hasnt been test to the max the design remind me of a volvo boxy if you know what i mean im very impress with this motorola headset but must admit that i prefer my plantronic bluetooth headset which is in this price range i am not complain about this one i just really prefer the other because i like its design better
3) amazonbasic score again theamazonbasic accessory bundle for smartphonesi a great value for quality accessory use for more than smartphone per murphy law on the same day i received car charger for our new motorola razr smartphone i was offer this item the razr arrive with a wall charger similar to the one included in this bundle but its a lighter weight and has two usb port the cable is of a lighter weight than this cable and the retractable prong are not as sturdy as those on this amazonbasic plug the motorola do not have a light but this one has a red light that illuminate when plug in to an outlet for this plug along i love the bundle add to that a more sturdy car charger than the motorola id ordered but this one also has a light and its more sleek than the motorola have the option to use the same long usb cable for both option is a major plus because that means for less to carry around at times like last week when we had a power outage of a few days and i had a new smartphone to learn the stylus is my first and its large than other ive try out im not sure to what i would attach the string but its there anyway use it on the razr i find it extremely sensitive and im get accustomed to use it without as much pressure applied to the screen on the kindle fire its great and i have no problem use it on the screen keyboard i try the wall charger out on my rd generation kindle but have not yet try it in the car i expect that it will also work well but expect it may take more time the charger work great on my gps and bluetooth earpiece this is a great set that i highly recommend
4) im not eager to award a product with a single star but theblueant endure bluetooth headset retail package blackha earn one measly star ive been use aplantronic discovery bluetooth earpiece cerise retail package for four years without complaint and would recommend that headset hand down over this one id definitely not recommend the blueant because of its poor design lousy fit flimsy construction terrible pair and most important undesirable sound quality there are many other bluetooth headset available with better characteristic at a much lower cost so id investigate other and try them out if you can
5) plastic case is weak link camera quality is tops in the past several week weve use the samsung galaxy s in black and electric blue as well as the htc one m the htc audio win hand down as do its basic appearance but the samsung phone are also great this black phone is more of a dark gray than true black and the entire case is plastic give it a cheap appearance i love the electric blue color but since all phone are protect by case cover the rear are not visible anyway unlike the htc this one offer a remove battery which along with its superior camera are why we purchase a pair of these on verizon wireless the phone arrive loaded with app which are unnecessary and not want so what we could easily remove we did the health app is use daily by my daughter im not as diligent myself a weakness of this phone particularly as compare to the htc is the rear speaker which muffle the audio while the phone is rest ive found that by keeping it face down its easy to hear the fingerprint security option hasnt work well for either of us so its not current being use samsung use its own power port think of a usb with a small twin port the same as the samsung tablet in general this is a really good phone which i expect will last the two years of our contract"

3) small in size big in performance this is a very small headset but it outperform other that are bulky and to set up button that control things is easy to find i use the over the ear loop to help keep it in place no complaint at all about the sound is great this is one of the headset i use nice indeed
4) nice holder for the phone while walking or working this is a great holder for my iphone when i am walking around and dont want it clip to my belt or in my pocket or when i am do some work and want it handy so i can see who is calling quick without have to drop everything to get to my phonelook good its sturdy and hold the phone in armband and easy to use

2) your experience may vary my main bluetooth headset for the past couple of years has been theplantronic discovery bluetooth headset bulk its a quality functional piece with great sound clarity and i was hope for the same from the jabra extreme unfortunately jabra fail to deliver the same type of dependable ive grown to love from receiving the unit i hooked it up to my pc and was up and go in no time setup was completely painless a huge plus for any bluetooth device when i start use it however the sound quality was terrible massive static on my end and whoever i was speak with had a hard time hearing me clearly i try it several different times in different situation and still the same result each time by the lack of success over the internet i try it out with my cell phone again the sound quality was awful i was almost ready to give up on the jabra extreme completely but i decided to give it one last chance this time with my playstation surprising my conversation was crisp and clear while game with this new found success i try it one last time with my cell phone only to be let down again by the awful qualityi dont know exactly why i had no success at all with it on my pc or cell phone when my plantronic works great with both for what it is the jabra extreme is comfortable to wear and will work nicely for me as a ps headset however because of its lack of overall dependable id recommend check out all other option first before decide on this purchase
3) couldnt be happy ive own several different bluetooth headset over the years and this motorola htxt is easily the best i couldnt believe how easy it was to pair with my samsung dart i just turn them both on and that was it they were pair the range is great i can walk throughout my whole two level and not lose it if you do happen to wander out of range just come back within range and it instantly reconnect it come with different ear pieces with hook without so you can choose what most comfortable for you ive never had an issue with it coming loose and it feel extremely comfortable in my ear call quality seem top notch also as i havent had any complaint on my call yet overall i can very enthusiast recommend the motorola htxt universal bluetooth headset base on my own great experience with it"

2) defective or quality issue i had this item for about month or so when i notice it was smoking and actually had a small burn mark near the port this is not my main charge point it is kept in my living room and i only use it once in a while and my wife also use it on occasion but rarely together i have an iphone and she has a samsung for the amount of actual use it is very disappointing to see this thing fail so quick i would not recommend this item nor would i ever purchase another my concern would be what if this was someone main charge point and it short out during the night i see that as a major fire hazard"

2) decent protection and application the screen protector went on pretty easily no different than most protector ive use in the past the difference with this protector seem to be the texture its not quite as slick as some other ive use and tend to cause a little drag when im swipe ive been use it for several week now and its start to discolor scuff in the place i touch a lot i need to replace it because its distract i havent had that with other protector so im taking a star off for the durable otherwise its a solid bet
3) big trade off i want so badly to like this charge system but i just cant use ittwo biggest reason you cant use your own phone case and the charge sleeve offer littleno protection the face of the phone is fully expose the side are thinner than the width of the phone so if you were to drop it face down the entire impact would be taken by the screen the top end of the phone is expose too the ease of charge isnt worth the risk for a broken phone from one accidental drop you cant use a dock station the entire bottom end of the phone is cover i wish they design it so that you could still use dock station if you dont use them often it might not be a big concern for you but i use dock station for my ipod every day this was another deal breaker for meother concern the sleeve add additional bulk to the phone it make it long and just a bit base and charge system itself works flawless if this sleeve were design better offering more protection and the ability to still dock it without have to use and auxillary port i would be happy with it as it is for the expense of the base and the sleeve its just not worth the two seconds of time it will save me very unfortunate
4) love it many positive first of all the charger works very well i use it with my iphone cable and my phone charged just as quick as it normally do with the apple plug in the back fold into the charger so its small than i anticipate this will be great for travelingi can keep it plug in at my desk and charge two item at once instead of moving adapter around to fit into the outlet at the same timei dont need my computer to charge my its a great gadget if you have a lot of usb power device im really happy with it
5) wonderful lightweight and comfortable by far the smallest and lightest bluetooth headset ive use i love that it fold to an even small size when i need to throw it in my bag or connect sound is clear and i have had no complaint that my voice is coming through recommend
6) nice and sleek perfect fit for the new iphone the case it a hard plastic but still has a little give to itthe front extend out a little so if its drop face down the screen is protectedit lose one star because the onoff button on top is very hard to push im hope it will loosen up with timeoverall a great buy and highly recommend
7) nice protection sleek style this case has a nice sturdy feel to it its a little heavy than the one i was use but the extra protection is worth itthe case come in two pieces the inside rubbery part is a lot thick and sturdy than most two piece case ive try i had a minor issue get a tiny part of the lip over the front of my phone im sure most people wouldnt notice it but it bug me a little the rubber part is attach the metal part slips on nicely its a snug fit but not too hard to get onthe control are all easily it is a very nice case my hand keeps catching where the metal meet the plastic so its not a total seemless connection but its still a very sleek case that offer a lot of protectioni definitely recommend this product
8) love it one hand charge i have the early version of this charger as well as this one im very very happy with both of them the early version had some complaint that the wire came loose i didnt find that to be the case this version has the wire firm attach to the charger basethe base do not slide and its easy to plug your phone in one hand it also stand the phone at a nice angle so you can see the screen if you use your phone as a clock on your bedstand this charger is perfectthe only slight negative is you need two hand to the phone one to hold the base down and one to lift the phone still much easy than fumble with a charger wire
9) wonderful long term battery backup i have a few recharge back up charger they are great but i want something that can sit for long periods of time without drain so its ready when i need it this back up is small and slim and easily tuck into my daughter backpack so glad i wont be get anymore phone about to die text highly you plan on use it a lot the battery may get expensive but if you truly want it as an emergency backup that is ready when you need it this is an excellent choice will probably purchase another to keep in my car
10) ok if you know limitation if it maintain a bluetooth link with your phone you can have it beep to help you locate it if you lose bluetooth connective the device is useless given the issue with drop connection and app issue i personally have not had such issue i would advise for an update version if you do not have a strong wifi signal throughout your entire house this may not be the best product for you
11) quality product highly recommend wonderful i can charge my ipad and iphone at the same time and still have two open port for other item im constant charge bluetooth speaker backup battery kid phone etc the fold prong make it ideal for travel no more fight over the bedside outlet for charge all of our gear this charger is practically a necessity these days with everyone in the house have several item that need to be charged at once ive been use this charger pretty much around the clock and it hasnt heated up even the slightest bit
12) charger doesnt fit with case on i charge my phone a few times throughout the dayin car at work at night this case doesnt work with any of my charger i have to remove the case while i like the feel and protection the case offer its just not a good fit for me"

2) a great skin cover for the evo d i was a little nervous because this skin is about double the price for other skin for the evo don top of that the post office deliver it to the wrong address i was all set to buy another one and one of the much less expensive to boot that not to say that is expensive by any recently replace my blackberry curve for the evo and one of the things that i like about my old phone was that the skin and phone pouch kept that phone look good for yearsi bought case holster cover side pouch with belt clip for sprint htc evo d here on amazon and it fit perfectly with just a slight bit of room to give when i put the phone in the case i got a nice snug fitthi case itself is form fitting took it out the wrapper and it immediately snap over the phone slot are perfectly align although the usb connect will have to wiggle it a thick plastic not blown away by the gloss but there are few alternative for men great looks fine and snug fit in phone pouch what more could you ask oh and only stars
3) better design than my previous case when i bought the evod two years ago i immediately bought an extend battery because i had heard the nightmare story about android phone and battery lifethe battery start to depreciate in strength about month after use and has been clinging on to life since then the case however has serve me well until my business trip abroad a week ago the phone fell from my hand and the case cracked along the topi replace it with this battery and case and im here to tell you that i should have bought a spare battery for my spare battery a time agothi new mah battery is noticeable better than the original spare which took about a week for it to break in bearing in mind that with these lithium ion battery you have to fully charge them let them run down to nothing and repeat the process for several days this practice stretch the battery capacity to hold a charge for hoursthe other notable thing about this set is that the cover is actually design to be slim with the slight hump over the extend battery itself the phone actually feel for less than you cant be it
4) a if youre an active jabra sport a critical review jabra sport use with htc evo sports track intro and inspection test and battery strength optional sports track conclusion i love jabrathe been produce about a dozen or so different style of bluetoothenable headset and headpiece a year the company has also manage to get the full support of the wireless community where almost all of the wellknown device are connect with it and now there are software company produce innovate work seamless with your mobile phone the recommend optional sports track is one that i didnt realize that i need or would feel crazy is in my opinion the wireless accessory company out now bar nonethe set headpiece two overtheear headpiece attach by a rubber band i dont know if the rubber band contain a bluetooth connect or is just a material that connect the left and right earpiece while there be two bluetooth receiver for each ear in any case the band doesnt seem to serve any purpose if the band is indeed to wrap around the head for support the one size fit all doesnt i first walk a mile trek the headset would come loose and id find myself readjust as i walk and talk on the phone despite the reception and the battery strength i was all set the give the sport a star rating until i took it out for a spin on a few other occasion and never had that happen againthe second night i went out i subconscious firm adjust both pieces over my ear and it mold to the shape i never move from then on still the rubber band barely noticeable didnt seem to play any practical purpose if there was one in third night went just as wellafter about hour of use without charge it the battery finally went out a full charge came about hour after being plug inthe set also come with micro usb ac adapter and a of paperwork which to be honest is there for legal reason and nothing else once you turn on the headset power button the set will whisper in your ear power on making your phone discover in the wireless network section cause the headpiece to say connected all of the volume and fm radio buttons are selfevident one of the truly great features of this product is the fact that no one who was talk with me for any length of time knew i was talk to them on a bluetooth headset until a gust of wind came by even then they thought that i was holding the phone next to my face the clarity is above reception the audio fidelity was exceptional although the quality of audio depend on the file that youre use and not the device itself from music video to mp to my treasure collection it is better than the fidelity of bluetooth headset with the exception of the bose series but the bose has some drawback as i mention amongst the paperwork that included is an invitation to download the wireless app call endomondo sports track i first look at the advertisement and quick dismiss it as i have about app on my phone already and most i havent look at since i downloade it originally another app didnt seem appealing especially since my business was to test out the quality of the week into the play around with the sport i just happen to come across the package for the headset when i notice the advertisement again i went to the marketplace and pull up the app i quick notice that people who had downloade the app was use it for a host of different things much more than just running mile in an hourthe app is important because it can serve as a visual gps if youre walking running hike swimming or anything where you want to see where you start out and where youre at the stat heart pace calorie etc notwithstanding it is the ability of the program to inform you of where your location is how long it took to get there and the distance that really really impress me on the endomondo site you also have a feed where you can see other people from around the world use the app in real time to mark their bluetooth the application itself is notorious for drain battery power from the headset and the phone id recommend for this device since youre go to be use it primarily outdoors and perhaps for hour at a time this would be handy to keep energi to go mini micro usb tip everything from the price tag to comfort to fidelity to working with rd party app for your android or iphone the jabra sport is definitely a musthave
5) the days of wire connective are number motorola wireless sports headphone sf a critical review and add the onepiece bluetooth receiver to that list the benefit of a wireless stereo bluetooth headset device like this wireless stereo sport headset are rapid add all of the convenience of wire earphone such as highfidel speaker with in a compact design the ability to plug into portable mp mp and smartphone relatively inexpensive various price with the function of the onepiece bluetooth headset the ability to receive and respond to incoming call wireless radiofrequence connective long battery lifethe drawback has always been you need both kind if you want to listen to music in stereo hassle of wire the expense of buy two sports headphone is one of the better wireless headset i own its market as have hd speaker system its difficult to prove that its actually high definition but the dynamic range is incredible listen to stream audio up to kbp and mp at was a power of this device is its driver and its built in amplifier so if the music source is of lower quality there no way that the device will produce a hd sound it can receive and replicate what is transmit the good news is bluetooth pair device like a laptop or a smartphone usually has a builtin android phone like the evo d i own there are several very good free equalize that you can download from the marketplace when engaged the beauty of the headset is you are waterthe royal band uk in the one if you were here tonight jazzy on watch the documentary the was almost like being in a theater battery life the battery life was consistent between hour these past couple of week this was one of the things i most concerned with comfort they fit snug that the way i like it i have a bose wireless and im always concerned when walking outside with them because there nothing to keep them attach to the ear and unlike the jabra sport i didnt have to get use to them compare motorola to jabra sport the jabra sport is the other stereo bluetooth headset that i have and it too is market for active design jabra slim design slightly lighter but was a bit too long took a few days to get accustomed to the feel yellow w black trim sports theme large wraparound ear make for a snug comfortable fit black w chrome trim conservative design make it suitable for many large buttons easy to navigate easily accessible while buttons spread across both rl speaker the onoff button very small and difficult to find sound call good easily as good as moderate price earphone call reception very sound is between moderate and highend headphone the combination of the builtin amplifier along with the source equalize setting make sound reproduction life hour to fully hour for for amazon fluctuate conclusion as i mention these kind of headset will within years start to fully replace the wire headset that have become the of people with portable music player and smartphone gone will be the days when a snag wire means that youre shell out for good quality wire earphone these wireless stereo bluetooth do it all and considering the price of around youre actually buy an upper midrange headset for the price but without the worry of a wire connectionif youre in the market for a singleear bluetooth receiver id say consider buy one of these stereo bluetooth receiver for the price of a decent singleear you have all of the features except a hour battery life as oppose to about hour with a singleear piece but these can also double as a theater headphone that you can use as far away as think about this when youre watch a long movie like the lord of the ring real question is is the more robust speaker system of the motorola of such importance that youd be willing to pay the price difference instead of buy the jabra sport which is nothing to sneeze at last thing i am not an exercise junkie in fact with the exception of basic yoga and my strenuous exercise is far in my past my knee wont hold up under any kind of gym workout but these are market to the fitness junkie so my advice aside you might want to consider the objective advice of the fitness writer who have some thought to add about how it works in a if you plan you use these in a my purpose motorola wireless bluetooth headset sf stars
6) an allinone solution motorola roadster a critical review the roadster is motorola piece bluetooth car speaker and navigation system the system also has the ability to act as a receiver for stream audio and as a voiceactivate personal assistant via the android app my motospeak and motorola car a measurement of x x the device is noticeable broad and that not a negative criticism in anyway but just an beautiful metallic silver front has a touchpad on the bottom that allow you to control the musicaudio function the top keypad row control the phone function the right side is where the micro usb charge port and power switch is located my trip to the grocery store a mile away provided me with perfect opportunity to see how the device works outi engaged the motorola car finder app and it immediately ask me to take a snapshot this i discover was more for my benefit as a snapshot would help me to remember where i was park from a view but i decline and went on to the next screen just as i arrive at the mall i received a phone call the speaker on this device is before the conversation end i inquire about how well i sound i was impress that her answer was fine considering it was somewhat windy as i was coming into the parking lota few moments later i turn on the my motospeak and had the system text within seconds a voice blare out which number afterwards the system repeated the message i spoke to impressive after a couple of week of play around with all of the features there are some minor things that id like to see in a future version i wouldnt mind seeing a glass display instead of the metal mesh that cover the speaker so that display can give you a visual of where youre at or who calling any speaker can be move to the side and to the bottom id like there to be included a micro usb to ac adapter the device come with almost no charge and it took a couple of hour of it being plug in before the battery indicator light turn is important because the kit only come with a car charger if youre park in an area and will be there for a considerable amount of time i wouldnt leave this device lie around and especially not plug in this means on the other side that youll need to have an ac adaptor handy so the device can stay charged while indoors im not crazy about the price tag if it had a glass display and extra cords maybe but by itself i think a fair price would be in the there you have it motorola roadster stars
7) a good budget headset but with questionable bonus features motorola hk a critical review motorola bluetooth headset hk is a nice nofrill singleear bluetooth around depend on the fluctuate sale price this is a good buy if you want a headset that has a good call upto feeti have very small ear and i found the ear hook fit snug and yet very comfortable it connected to my evo d immediately and the voice attendant verify connective as well as battery this come with setup instruction i couldnt find any mention of the app you could use with your android phone but the android app motospeak seem to work much better with this device than my prefer app talk for upto clear call clear music to ft roam range front cover answer call from a football field connected to your phone up to feet away allow you to roam freely without your phone throughout your office home or yard obstruction may limit range of use back believe iti test out this device for days and youll get a reception under the best conditions of not even and most certainly not feeti call motorola illinois hq this morning in order to get perhaps some wade through the command for i was finally able to get a live person but my frustration didnt end thereafter our introduction the next minutes were spent listen to him read what was print on the box and deduce that maybe i had an old phone and perhaps there was just too much interference where im htc evo d is barely month as far as the interference issue is concerned i dont know of anyone whod be talk from an unobstructed view from an unattended phone at feet away believe me i wouldnt walk feet away from a phone that i paid plus tax because i felt that this phone was too heavy to carry if i did id have a different problem when i got all things being equal ignorant customer service aside if you measure the price against the basic function features it is a good hk stars
8) the best bluetooth this season motorola sflex hd a critical review about a month ago jaybird release what i thought to be the best new sports bluetooth headset this season jaybird freedom spirit jabra sport at this point was perhaps on the cutting edge with their wireless headset couple with endomondo sports track app a better than average microphone and a reasonable price was difficult to sf had a better speaker system and a more secure fit than the jabra sport but trail very slightly with battery company like sony with their xbabt offer a marginal better sound but sacrifice fit microphone and a decent battery life for a premium freedom spirit gave you two ways to fit the headphone both are extremely comfortable the microphone and speaker are above average but whose battery life and recharge time and annoy button arrangement really took away from a headset that had solve many of the issue of previous season model the two area where jaybird is deficient and designi not an issue with this new motorola sit seem as if motorola heard the legitimate criticism about the headphone release across the board last year and made some very noticeable improvement over their sf the earphone are just as snug but the earpiece is a little more flexible i especially like how they wrap around the head when you first take them out you notice a bit of a weight to them but youll soon forget that when you put them onthe battery life is a shade under hour hour of any of the following talk listen to music watch a movie on a bluetoothenable device and the headphone will chime and tell you how much battery life is that the sony dont dothe microphone issue is clear there is no sports bluetooth headset with as loud of a microphone system as these s period they blare when a call come in i was told during a mile walk back home that i was walking next to a noisy crowd and yet the nearest people a couple and their child were putt grocery in their trunk were about feet away when i got home i gave the lady my phone and headset and i grab my business phone and had her to call me on it as we walk outside of the house in different directions i had to hold the phone away from my it wasnt on speakerphone its battery recharge in less than minutes after being completely music and music sitting on my microsd card in my android phone sound crisp very little distortion compare the new motorola to amazon bestsell wireless sports headset sound fidelity call reception motorola s nov freedom sprint nov sport good comfort motorola s very cost jabra motorola sf jaybird motorola sony battery life jaybird sf s hour conclusion now has never been a better time to buy a wireless bluetooth headset the sound reproduction has improve dramatic over the past years and the cost has drop significant for the cost of replace a couple of good wire headset you could have a decent wireless bluetooth headsetat this point the best overall is the motorola s follow by the jaybird the jabra although about a year old is still a very good buy i love the snug feeling and the great speaker system in the sf but for a few dollar more id recommend the s over them i wouldnt recommend the sony under any the battery life and recharge cycle and the button design on the jaybird were different it would be very difficult to recommend the jaybird over the s or vice s stars
9) a very good accessory to keep in the car great accessory to have in your have another usb car charger and this works the same wayyou have a dual port for charge any usb device we have android phone and tablet and this is definitely something we keep in the car for your make the mistake of thinking that you have an accessory that will quick charge two almost empty device fast it will recharge an almost empty cellphone to near full capacity on a minute ride home when the phone screen is shut off and your not play any media from itif you try to plug device you see a dramatic decrease in charge capacity especially if that other device is a youre go on a long road trip take this along as well as an external battery pack
10) otterbox commuter for the galaxy s a critical review we just upgrade all of our phone and two of them are an s and the we got the commuter case we bought several accessory including the maxboost shell host combo so for us its essentially a comparison between the otterbox commuter to the maxboost commuter is a piece set that include a soft rubber case and a hard plastic cover that wrap around the back and side of the phone it also has a slim screen protector it doesnt have a belt clip though all for the maxboost is slightly slim yet it cover both the back and side very well it also has a design that feel good to the grip and a swivel holster way kickstand screen protector and kickstand a felt interior to protect the screen when the phone invert all for otterbox commuter plastic inner case hard outer case screen shell holster inner case hard outer case screen protector swivel holster way kickstand felt interior the commuter is not to be confuse with the topoftheline defend which will protect the phone from almost any kind of fall it is a good form of protection if youre relatively careful with your phonei didnt like the fact that a kickstand and belt clip was not built in and when compare to other private case maker like maxboost are making better basic hardcover case and for a lot less
11) lugulake bt bluetooth speaker a critical review the bt is one of most elegant of wireless speaker i have seen in some timethi bluetooth speaker is also doubles as external wire speaker for your old analog or mobile device with a mm review unit is a brown but is more like a pearl speaker features x and has a builtin tablet holder in the front two watt speaker on the left and right bluetooth or roughly of wireless connective micro usb and mm cable mah internal battery for a hrs of use depend on the loud and use of other the accompany video i play a few random track to give you an idea of the sound reproduction of this the whole the unit is a very good set that is not what this means is that the speaker is very versatile if you like a of music from time to time but if you listen to bassheavy music exclusively the speaker probably wont appeal to you but for me this is a positive because i know this kind of speaker typically has less noise distortion at the lower frequency and reproduce vocal more thing that should be pointed out is that this speaker by a newly form private audio company is market toward mass market once and a while ill get a question about how do this device stack up against this or thatthere are three grade of of the device on amazon are for the consumer market with an equal amount share between the division and the professional division the standard like the price are much higher as you go up the this consumer grade device is well made the sound is very good and its elegant design means that it fit nicely with your better audio equipment or cellular device and not like those gaudy look product that offer little in the way of value for the device is a winner
12) duracell powermat go power overnight external battery a critical review duracell go power overnight is mah lithium ion external battery and is a part of their powermat charge systemthe set come withthe usb to usb some peripheral device in the duracell system the go power overnight can charge a cellphone or a tablet wireless but by itself it can function separate as an external ion battery have to be is charged to full capacity drain until completely empty before recharge this should be done for several days in order for the battery to perform at its maximum battery has a light indicator and it measure x x and weigh about mah battery can recharge a tablet or a phablet once or a standard cellphone iphone or android twice before need rechargingthe cost is the biggest issue for me for about the same price you can have a mah battery from a private label and very good one to is a nicely design unit but it should have at least double the charge capacity for the price
13) multipurpose car mount i have access to the company car and a cellphone car mount is an important piece of furniture to have especially since its now a nd degree in the state of florida to text and cnet publish a video of multiple use for cellphone device and they use a car mount for demonstrate how to set up a mobile for your home or office use a car mount an old touchscreen cellphone and a can use a car mount like this one from arkon to keep watch on an area for less than half of what it cost to buy a security system and that doesnt include the cost of the monitor and cable need for arkon car mount of itself is well built and not one of those cheap made discount for your car or as a piece this is a good product to have if interested ill leave the link to the video in comment section below

2) good sound quality comfortable fit great battery life i have own many bluetooth headset over the years so here is my opinion of the plantronic m in comparison first of all this headset can stream music or podcast from your smart phone which none of my previous headset could do it also has builtin noise reduction to reduce or eliminate background noise like wind rain traffic or music it has voice alert that tell you the battery level volume level talk time and more it has a special battery meter that will show up on your screen if you have an iphonethi headset sync easily on my samsung gravity touch or ps if you happen to play video games online the sound quality is good for an average price headset i dont have any problem with disconnect or voice have also own other headset that tend to want to move or feel like they are go to fall off not a problem with this one its held secure in place and is fairly comfortablei love the battery life on this headset and it will last me at least hour of constant use i usually stick with a motorola headset because most of them also have good battery life i have had many headset that only last for about hour and i didnt like that at all you can get a lot of use out of this headset without constant recharge itthi headset will come with a wall charger and its cover by a year limited warranty for the price i think this is one of the better headset option at the present time
3) great battery life comfortable fit and sound good this is a good low cost headset it may not be the fanciest headset but it works very well the sound quality is good and what i have come to expect of motorola headset the battery life is fantastic and if you can deplete the battery in a single day then you are probably spend far too much time on the phone because it will last for at least hour it sync easily on my samsung gravity touch phone and on my playstation it come with a simple wall charger and will charge pretty fast if your headset battery die then a minute charge will get you a couple hour of talk time the headset fit well in my ear and doesnt move or hurt my ear like some headset do i have own five or six motorola headset and they have all work well except for one so motorola has a good track record for me
4) works well and is comfortable to use silver and chrome finish looks nice and it has a builtin ball point pen there a million different type and brand of stylus to choose from you can find anything from the cheapest little plastic stylus to a very fancy one with multiple features i dont expect a lot out of a stylus other than it needs to look nice and be comfortable to use of course it needs to work well as well this stylus meet all of my expectations it works well when you touch the screen it always register your touch of course you have to get use to push a little hard than is necessary with your finger but that is the case with any and all different stylus stylus also looks nice and with its silver color and chrome look trim its smooth exterior and well balanced body make it comfortable and enjoyable to use as an add bonus it has a builtin ball point pen it also come package in a case so its easy to give as a gift the case is somewhat cheap but for the price its not bad at all these would make a good stocking provided for review
5) small and simple but works well i like that it attach to your keychain this mah battery pack is nice and compact at only about inch long and less than an inch wide it come in a simple black case that say power bank on one side and is white with the oxa logo on the other side its a basic design but it has a keychain on the other end i really like the keychain option so its always with you when you need it i have use about different battery pack like this and that was a new and interesting option to me it come with the usual usb cord that is use for charge the battery pack and also power up whatever device you are connect the battery pack to it also come with a variety of different adapter that can be use to power up different cell phone or other device it also come with the adapter need to connect to the ipad or if you need to connect a lightning cable to it then you will just plug it into the battery pack and not use the included cable you can more or less use it with any device that charge via usb cablethi battery pack wont fully charge my ipad but it will give it a nice boost it will allow me at least or hour of use before recharge again if you travel a lot or use your device a lot then its very convenient to have a battery pack like i said before i have use many different battery pack some of them are very small and some are large some are very cheap and some are more expensive this one doesnt have some of the option that i have seen on more expensive model like a builtin flashlight or a power button but you pay for those option if you are look for a low cost battery pack that is reliable and works well but without all the bell and whistle then this battery pack might be a good choice for provided for review
6) high are crisp and clear but lacking as far as bass go important to be made for people with small ear these headphone come with a very brief instruction manual usb cord and wall charger instead of replace battery you just recharge these headphone that a big plus for me because battery arent convenient when you run out and dont have any more on hand they are also very expensive to buy all the time and wasteful you can either use the usb cord to plug it into your computer or usb hub to charge or you can utilize the included wall charger to charge it the wall charger make more sense most of the timemy last pair of headphone has me a little spoil because they are top of the line and sound amazing i am not go to say that these headphone sound just as good because they dont however there is a huge price difference between the two and i have to take that into consideration when it come to the sound quality the high sound crisp and clear and you can hear all the little detail that you might be missing with cheap headphone the low are a little lacking in my opinion they can produce some bass but its very limited these headphone also dont go as loud as my last pair and just dont have the power i will say for the price these are still very decent and a good they look great with their shiny black finish they have a volume adjust on the side along buttons to move forward or backward through music track there is also a power button that is use to turn on or off the headphone and also to sync the headphone via bluetooth to your compatible device i stream music to these headphone from my ipad and havent had any problem at all i was able to sync these to my ipad easily on my first attempt without any problem i love have fully wireless headphone because i can listen to music while do chore around the house without carry my ipad around i have a medium size house and i can go anywhere on the same floor within about feet with minimal loss of signal i have try go to the basement or upstairs but it constant loss the signal that bluetooth technology for you though that doesnt have anything to do with the quality of these headphone issue that i have with these headphone is that they are apparently made for people with really small ear i think my ear are more or less average size but inner section of the part that sound the ear is hardly big enough and it isnt the most comfortable at all they are fully adjust in size and they have a cushion that rest on the top of your head for comfort overall though i think these headphone are quite good for the cost even with a few problem
7) works great has safety shut off in case of a short and i like the bright blue face plate this wall charger white and has four usb port on the front three of the port are amp for charge lower power device like the iphone the last usb port is amp for quick charge of higher power device like the ipad combine it has amp so you can use all four port at the same time without slow down that charge time i have a couple similar wall charger that will slow down if there are multiple item plug in at the same time its made solid and seem to work very well the plug flip down or close into the body of it for travel and storage the face of it is a blue panel that will bright illuminate when in use this make it stand out from similar wall charger and i like the look of iti found out the other day that it has a builtin safety mechanism that can sense if there is some type of short or problem i has plug in one of my device to charge and the usb cable that i use to charge it had a short in it i saw a spark and smoke roll up from the cable and then the wall charger immediately shut down that port and the light on the front of the wall charger kept flash to indicate there was a problem i never thought of that before but its good to know that it will shut down if there is ever a problemoverall i think this wall charger is reasonably price and seem to be good quality i like the safety feature and the led lights that illuminate the front face plate in bright blue provided for review
8) nice look and works well but only has a single usb port and only mah capacity this battery pack is small to medium size and it its black with a mirror type of finish it really looks like a small cell phone more than it looks like a battery pack it has a power button on the side and four little led lights on the front that tell you when its charge how much it has left to charge they also illuminate when you are use it to power a device and will tell you how much charge is left on the battery pack it come with a usb cable that is use for charge it and can also be use to charge most cell phone you need to charge an ipad or iphone then you use the ipad or iphone cable to connect to the battery pack it has a builtin flashlight that can come in handy on occasion i use it sometimes in my dark truck if i need to see somethingthe only downside that i have found so far is that it only has a single usb port so you cant charge more than one device at the same time i have many other battery pack that all have at least two usb port so i found that a little disappointing the single usb port do output amp so its good for charge high power device like an ipad but it can be use for any device the battery capacity is mah which is almost enough to fully charge my ipad but not quite the new ipad have a much large battery so it wouldnt even come close to fully charge one of them i could have use a little more battery capacity in my opinion this battery pack is better suit for charge a cell phone or other small electronic device my wife daughter son and myself all have our own ipad so extra battery capacity and extra usb port are important to i like the appearance of this battery pack and it works well but its usefull is limited only have a single usb port and a small mah provided for review
9) inexpensive well made and can be use for a variety of different device smartphone gps ipad mini or other small tablet this smartphone and tablet holder come with a long bend arm suction cup smartphone holder and a tablet holder its easy to mount just clean you window push the suction cup firm into place and flip the switch on the suction cup it locks firm into place and doesnt fall off then decide which adapter to use and screw it on you can easily switch the adapter whenever you want the adapter slide large and spring shut to fit a variety of different item and hold them nice and secure they have a rubber pad on both side so the device doesnt slide around or get smartphone and tablet car mount is great for a variety of different things it can be use to hold your smartphone for hand free talk through speakerphone or through a bluetooth headset its perfect if you use your smartphone as a gps unit because the arm is so long and it bring the gps close to you if you have a new gps unit then it should fit into this holder i have two different brand one is sony and the other is magellan and they both fit nicely into this holder both of my gps unit come with a simple holder that doesnt give you many option this holder allow you to put the gps where you truly want it and bring it close to you this holder will even hold an ipad mini if you want i test my ipad mini in it and it fit just fine and it could hold the this smartphone and tablet holder is excellent because its price fair well made and can be use for so many things best of all it stays stuck to the window and doesnt fall off like provided for review
10) so very cute and it works well include usb to lightning and micro usb cable this cute little keychain is perfect for young kid and maybe some adult its basically a multifunction cable that has usb on one end and lightning and micro usb on the other end the cable is wrap up inside a cute little blue hippo that is made of silicone its really quite adorable and i think most kid would get a kick out of itthe cable itself is about inch long when not in use its held inside the hippo when you need to use it you pull it out of the hippo mouth and stretch it out dont worry the hippo is tough and you wont hurt him i have use it to charge my phone with the micro usb cable and it has work fine it also works well to charge my ipad mini but it may be difficult to use while your ipad or ipad mini is in a casethi cable is inexpensive and the hippo is so cute it works well and i think it was a brilliant idea i would recommend this for your young one i think they will enjoy itsample provided for review
11) it can charge on both port at the same time without power loss this usb car charger is black and has a square front with round edge the edge where you grab it to pull it out have these little rubber dot that help you grip it to pull it out of the cigarette adapter it fit nice and snug into the adapter and doesnt wiggle around out lose power some similar usb car charger that i have use dont fit as well as this oneit has two port on the front one charge up to amp and the other charge up to amp the total maximum output is amp so you can use both port at the same time at full power and without sacrifice speed some adapter have a total maximum amp that is insufficient to charge on both port at the same time at full power that not a problem with this oneother than that its pretty simple there is nothing especially fancy about it but its inexpensive its simple and works provided for review"

3) good earpiece but you can get better for slightly more just to provide a point of reference im benchmark my comment again my current ear piece motorola use in the galaxy s skyrocket running android iphone s running ios s running ios ear piece comfortable but if you break the fully adjust ear hook and need to use the rigid one its less average ear piece use motorola flip mic to turn the device onoff absolutely my favorite feature motorola has a slide button which make it easy to tell when the device is off but not as convenient as the flip ear piece tell you when you are tell you when you are ear piece roughly about feet the earpiece will tell you when you are out of range and pick the call back up as soon as you get back into the range about feet however if you exceed the range the unit will tell you that you are loose connective and when you walk back it will tell you that you are regain the setup went smooth on the android device however i had to try pair the earpiece with the two iphone a couple of times before it connected once the connection was made i never had a ear piece great sound and noise cancel the sound quality is noticeable less crisp than my current earpiece in some case it sound like you are talk to someone at a distance outdoors no issue in moderate to heavy v time is great time was not i wish the hx boom to turn onoff the earpiece this is absolutely my favorite feature in my current earpiece you never have to guess if the earpiece is off or motospeak you to dial via talk to the earpiece and respond to text message great feature that is a must it would be a better investment to spend the additional money to get one of the following item from motorola htxt hx or elite flip the difference in price is anywhere from to but you will get a much nice earpiece all three of the aforementione item have motospeak and the flip mic feature"

2) loving itupdate after some more use update there is a little lag but nothing like what i had on my old blue tooth when i am listen to the navigation command on my phone and so little that i hadnt notice it when i first try it out audio is good it connect and disconnect very quick the buttons are easy to use nobody has complain about hearing an echo the microphone is pretty strong though and outside noise is readily apparent to the person on the other end also because of the outside noise it is sometimes impossible for me to use the voice command on my phone the headset is comfortable but just do not feel secure and i always feel like i have to adjust it to hear better it has not come off or fallen off bit it just feel like it might i would like to have had the chance to have a small ear bud piece that could be use with the earloop i think that would have made all the difference if i could i might drop it to stars but no way can i justify stars so i left my star rating as is i am still happy to have it and enjoy use it but the honeymoon overi just got the jabra extreme and i love it let me tell you pair it was no problem change the attachment to better fit on my ear was easy it came charged and ready to use instruction booklet is short and sweet and easy to use it is not the most comfortable headset however that is really the only negative and that is why i did not give it starsbut this is easily stars i love all that come with this usb charger car charger and wall charger some are not happy with the short cord of the ac charger however i like it as it keeps it close by and less likely to be step on or otherwise damage the sound quality is excellent and there is no lag i have a dare and with my old plantronic there was a lag that would make me miss the first word the phone would say this was extremely bad when use the function no such problem with the jabra also i should note that nobody has complain of an echo while i use this again this was a problem with my plantronic i do wish there were different size ear bud that came with the unit that work with the overtheear attachment there are two different size attachment for over the ear as well as two different size bud that fit into the ear i dont feel they would hold as well so far i am very happy with this
3) you get what you pay for i have use several different blue tooth headset and for me the gold standard is my motorola oasis try out the samsung was disappointing and i have samsung flat usually a big fan our cell phone are also sammy they are the reality phone there are a couple of plus you get a nice little assortment of extra in the box the voice is very pleasant the nicest i have ever heard by far so far everything was go well and show a lot of i made a phone call the the other person sound so far away i thought that my earpiece was not in well i kept fiddling with it but nothing help nothing like the oasis worse than that i could not make a call use the voice command it would constant hear a message command when i clearly was saying call that was enough to give it a bad score what the point of hand free when you have to pick up your phone scroll through the contact find the one your are look for call that person then put the phone back down by the time i am done i could get two ticket and an accident the only reason i did not give it one star is the voice it really sound nice not computerize and not cold it did not hang in my ear and kept moving i had to readjust it often the other plus is this is the only headset other than the oasis that did not have a terrible lag when use my phone navigation that kind of important when you are not sure which way to turn etcso this is certainly a cheap note i did not say inexpensive headset there may be some value here but i just dont see it this may work different on other phone but i thought since it was a sammy it would be great with my phone it obviously wasnt i say pass on this one there is way better out there
4) i almost love it my gold standard for blue tooth headset is the motorola oasis i love it i have to say the hk is pretty darn good first let me say that it is a good if not great value it is relatively comfortable not as comfortable as the oasis especially for the design i still have to readjust this but not as often as some other brand namely samsung i think if it came with different size cover for the ear bud it would be better the ear bud is kind of large battery life is excellent and while i use it a lot i dont have to recharge it for easily days distance is about feet from my phone and then it disconnect the only thing that really keeps this from a star rating is have to readjust it a minor annoyance and its maximum volume a major annoyance it is actually hard for me to hear people if they are not speak loud if i could i would give this stars but it really is better than stars so the hk get the nod to stars i also like that it tell me the battery status when i turn it on pair is easy as it should be and the charger works perfectly on my samsung the control take a little get use to but they work well and are fairly intuitive you really dont need to read the instruction volume control calling pick up etc is on and off take some get use not much but for me its not where i would have expect itit is on the bottom and i am not use to it there i like the big power button i just had to get use to it and i did for the price i dont think you can find a better bluetooth headset than the even if you spend a bit more this is number to the oasis come on motorola give us a better fit into the ear and let us make it a bit loud and its a home run even at a higher price
5) a bit shiny but nice especially for the winter this is certainly a winter look cover for the iphone and fit the iphone well the finish is a little shiny and in the photo it looks a little but in person it looks much nice and for those who are really fashion this is a great winter case the only real problem i have with these belkin case is they dont give you much screen protection but the rest is protect well and the case is pretty light i like the hardness of it and while it is shiny it do not collect fingerprint easily it clean up well and it doesnt collect lint like the rubberize one
6) smooth with a funky design somehow the belkin shield spot case remind me of water the bubble design is fun and a little mellow the colors are nice and blend well together it fit the iphone perfectly but the only problem i have is that i wish the lip was a little big to give my screen a little more protection the polycarbonate finish feel nice and is not slippery but also do not give you any extra grip the nice part about it is that it do not attract and hold lint like some rubberize case it always looks clean and if it do get dirty like if your kid start play with it after they just ate some chocolate it easily wipe clean it also do not pick up fingerprint unless your kid just finished eat chocolate the glossy surface made me think it would gather fingerprint like crazy so i was very happy to find that it didnt the fit is tight and not that easy to remove which is nice i did have to press kind of hard to get it in and that always make me nervous i will update if the design wear off easily but for now it seem quite durable
7) if i had small finger i might be in love omg the mac is pretty amazing it is almost perfect and i would have given it stars except for a few things that i will mention later first it really hold my iphone perfectly i mean it is in therei was a little nervous get it in but now i know it is not go anywhere you do have to be a little forceful but youll get iti do wonder how much extra stress the pressure put on the screen however and i wonder if you drop it will that extra pressure but worse and make it more likely to crack the glass i just dont know and i dont plan on drop it with that said this is a nice case that doesnt bulk up your phone as much as other case out there i love the belt clip i dont want to keep it in my pocket it will break for sure it is very handy to have on my belt and it slide in and out easily enough without still worry that it can fall out on its own the stand for me is useless but it is still a nice feature i just dont have a need for it lately i have been seeing so many things that seem over price and low quality not so with the mac talk about value i think you get a lot for your money the only other negative i can say is that i have a very hard time with the volume control i think if i had small finger it might be easy but even them im not sure for me this is not normally a big deal as i dont usually play around with the volume but it is worth note i would give this stars there is enough around the screen to keep it relatively safe a nice case with nice features and seem to be good quality it is also very rugged look
8) not so natural view the thing i hate most about anitglare screen protector is the granular it presents this is not as bad as other i have try but it is still present and i dont think there is any way to get around it you will be give up a little bit of image quality if you dont mind that then youll love this im not so happy about it as i love the image quality i normally have and so do my wife i actually put it on hers i got lucky on this one and got one very tiny bubble on the corneri count that as a success the protector fit well cover well and protect the screen from light scratch especially from key that might be floating around in her bag if she had kept it on i dont know how long it would have last after one week it was pretty scuff but in all fair she has a lot in her said it almost feel like there is a filter over the screen i understand what she means it is subtle but you can tell a difference without it still as far as antiglare go this is probably the best i have seen so if glare is an issue for you this is the one to get if not i would pass and get a protector that is truly clear this is also relatively inexpensive compare to some other screen protector
9) one small bubble on edge very clear great protector i love it i got one small bubble that pushed to edge but will not go away normally my ocd tendency would make me nuts however my past experience with screen protector have left me somewhat cure and i am now quite happy to just have this little bubble in fact i look at it as a kind of triumph whether it is my improvement or the quality of product i cannot tell you but i would say it is a combination of both i use a special microfiber cloth that came with my care to clean the screen really well almost buff it smooth then i careful start from one corner use one hand to hold the corner in place while the other hand kind of flex the screen down i will note that with other brand i have gotten more bubble i dont know why i can get the bubble to the edge and not have it push completely out but it really is small and i dont notice it anymore the cover fit perfectly and it offer good scratch protection i can easily recommend the belkin screen protector keep in mind you get in the pack and i have not had to change the first one great value
10) update price drop great protection easy to use slightly uncomfortable clip update still go strong folks this is the best case i ever i dont even care that the price has drop to it was worth every penny then and an even better bargain now i should also note that the plastic screen protector is still greatand that with two kid who love to jump on me constant i havent found anything better for my s i think enough of this that after a year i am update it good job otterbox price update june saw it drop to and change then back upupdate just an fyi folks this is current at and free shipping this is a no brain and a steal none of the stores around me are give any kind of they have iti still love this case but i did want to let you know that if you rely on the vibration to notify you you might miss some call this do soften the vibration quite a bit if you are holding it its not a problem but sometimes when it is on my belt with a shirt tuck in and i am walking i do not feel the vibration there is no problem if i am still i also think that this is in part due to the phone the vibrate strength even on full is not as strong as my old phone so the extra cushion from the case just soften it up even morebut you know what this weekend i have seen three people with this phone and belkin case and they all had cracked get a belkin case for my s it took me only an hour to go out and buy theotterbox defend series and holster case for samsung galaxy s pack retail package black the difference is night and day and while this is more than twice the price of the belkin it is total worth it plus you dont need to spend money on a screen protector so it really isnt that much morethe defend is really a three piece full coverage case it provide full coverage for your s corner back front screen and it has flip cover for the charger connection etc and those flip flip up easily even without fingernail the case itself provide excellent grip all around without being intrusive it is a little difficult pressing the buttons on the face but my finger are a little big one of my favorite things is the screen protectorno bubble yup you heard me right no bubble that because you dont actually have to apply the protector to the screen this is awesome if you look at every screen protector i have review for my iphone and ipad they all had bubblesi have come to hate bubble and thought i would have to learn to live with them i am here to tell you i am now bubble free and so is my pressing the side buttons you do have to press a little hard but for the protection you get its fine also the opening for the camera are angle so that the thick case do not appear in the pictures the case itself is to provide good grip without feeling is no interference at all with use the ir when reading and scroll down by nod my head or turning a page with a wave of my hand share pictures and video work equally as well with no perceptible interference the only real issue is that i did notice a slight difference in wifi reception in our house with the case on it is slightly weak but nothing big and after one day i dont even think about it the entire screen and nothing is only thing that i would knock half a star for is the clip is uncomfortable and digs into my skin when its on my belt and is especially bad when my shirt is not tuck in they could have made this better and i wonder will come and downgrade this to stars later because of this for now i will say stars with an easy to instruction when install your remove the rubber gasket use your fingernail there are little space along the side you need to use these to seperate it or you risk break it once that is done the rest is easy try not to touch the inner portion of the screen as it come perfectly clean at least it did on both of ours putt everything together after this pointi easy and take less than seconds gently click everything together and you are ready to both love this case and i highly recommend it"

2) small powerful this here bluetooth is among the best that ive own to use with my cellphone and ive own plenty of them see my review on plantronic motorola etcthe negative ill get out of the way first as one is total absurd to me as to why a company would do the first is the length of the charge cord from the actual ac charger that plug into the wall to the adapter which plug into the bluetooth the cord is around six inch so most likely youll need an extension cord and long power strip now if you have an outlet in an open area then this is not a problemthe last ill call a is the size of the bluetooth itself the size is so small and its powerful in pick up your voice and battery life but with that come it being difficult to touch the right buttons especially if you have large finger or are wearing it and want to turn the volume keep in mind this is a very small bluetooth headset lightweight small so that its easy loose if youre not careful and if you have puffy cheek the bluetooth will not hit your cheek and muffle the sound so small that many will not notice you are wearing it as it do not protrude along the side of your facethe over the ear part is a small wire and that great if you wear glasses as it do not bother the stem of the glasses however the first few times you wear it over the ear itll be difficult to put on and feel strange however that feeling go away after a few times and its very easy to change the wire for leftright ear it come fit for the right ear and i like wearing them on my left earand there is a in ear piece that help the speaker stay in your ear with both wire behind the wear and the in ear piece you dont notice this you have a true fit bluetooth that do not wiggle around as you was easy the onoff button bluetooth is a simple slide updown range of the bluetooth is a good feet depend on conditions if you have wall in between or floor or are in an open area etc battery life is among the best ive quality is very clear and caller can hear me has a color system and when it turn green on the headset its fully charged red means it needs to be charged yellowish color means its in between is also an extra wire for behind the ear extra ear piece and a dc car charger have a small bag would of been nice to include but im sure everyone could find something or purchase a small bag to keep it with the small wire i cant understand why jabra would give such a small give this full stars jabra has a real nice bluetooth again if you wear glasses or sunglasses then you will be very happy with this bluetooth as the behind the ear piece is very small and do not bother the stem of your glasses
3) great headset like other jabra product here is another good bluetooth headset the setup is straight forward it come with a car charger usb charger and a electric home charger note the wire for the home charger is small so unless you have easy access to the wall socket you will probably wan to use an extension cordthi headset is like other where you can wear it behind the ear or inside the ear or both i like both as the chance of it fall off if you move around a lot while talk are headset seem to sell itself on noise cancel while it do cancel noise im not sure that it cancel noise better than any other it do cancel noise but ive yet to find one that cancel outside wind well and i mean this one as well while many are not outside in windy conditions use their cellular phone i do and people on the other end still hear it the whoosh of wind and volume do not go real high but that is not enough to take away a star as i consider real wind a harsh condition it do cancel running water like from the faucet volume will increase people talk and automobile this is a very small item you may well look for a small bag or case or such to keep it in when not in use as its easy to misplace sit on etc this is something i would like to see company include with the product
4) works with my droid im use this on my motorola droid it work right out of the box pair up with no in my ear with no problem you can wear it with just the ear bud or the behind the ear clasp however i prefer both just to have it on double and prevent an life ive gotten four days honestly i cannot say how much i talk per day perhaps an hour all together wearing it standby i have it on around six hour a day come through well and people hear me well talk in wind rain or crowd is not the best but then again ive yet to find one that do a great job at this even when warning is if you perspire a lot the headset will slip around and if you are jog it could slip off wipe around your ear help or just remove the headsetthe range do not come into play with me as i keep my phone with me and operate everything from my phonei dont have any complaint on this headset
5) large headneck people beware with all bluetooth headset you must do your homework before purchase itthi remind me of the old fashion hearing aid my grandfather hadthi headset is truly a headset with this everyone will know you are wearing a bluetooth headset it fit in your ear and there is a cord that go do a clip box if you wear or will be wearing a tight top female a with low cut this may be a problem be aware you need to clip this somewhere i had on a muscle shirt and after a hour of this against my skin it wasnt comfortable its a firm clip and ive yet to have it fall off anything but again it must clip on something up near your shoulder you can clip it on the back of your shirt however i didnt find that may want the geeky look and if so this is just for if you have a large long head or neck this cord can pull if you make sudden idea would be for azeca to make a model with a large cord so you could run it down your back and clip it on your beltthe product itself is good it pair up with my droid without a problem i hear people well they hear me i dont have a problem with as i have my phone within a few feet of the headset at all times belt pocket bag etcthe earbud is very comfortable it fit firm in your ear no irritation like some other do to the inside of your ear after wearing it for a few hoursbattery life i get around hour of straight that this is the start and ive yet to find a bluetooth headset that after a few month the time doesnt go down until it needs to be charged every night im sure this is the battery and until they find a better battery there little that can be you dont mind the cord or clipping it onto your shirt then this is great its around twenty dollar cheap than the other model of wireless bluetooth
6) a must case for sony xperia tablet if youre gonna buy the sony xperia tablet z inch then this is the case you the price and features you cannot go to startthe tablet slide into the holder via a velcro holder inside the case be sure to line up the side correct so you can charge the tablet while its in the case hole are made for each portthe case has a magnetic screen onoff feature so that each time you open the case and your tablet is turn on your screen will automatic go on close the case and the screen go off team this up with the tablet feature to auto turn the wifi offon when not in use and the battery will last many also a hand strap in the back so you can safe hold the tablet in your hand without do that balance act we all do and there a stylus of this for under twenty cannot go wrong
7) mixed review i had big plan for thishowever when it arrive issue use this trackr on an iphone si had problem from the start with the two eventually they pair but it take to get them togetherthe trackr is a bit on the bulky side that is slide it in your wallet credit card holder andit take up about the size of three credit cardsthe range is twelve clear can only use one trackr at a time that is if youhave two trackr your phone can only recognize one service emaile me back within hour twice so im give a as i believe customer service is so few improvement and this can be a winner"

2) perfect for me i broke one of the back glass panel on my iphone within a week of purchase it ive use a case every since but the hard case seem to only protect against scratch and the soft rubber case made it difficult to get in and out of my pocket this case seem to be the best of both world because it combine a soft case inside of a hard plastic case make it easy to stick in a pants pocket and absorb some of the impact from drops and fallsthe case itself is well made and all the cutout and button work like they should the glossy black plastic will scratch and do show fingerprint but so will most glossy plastics"

2) external battery pack for ipod touch i have an ipod touch th generation that i use alot as such the battery on the unit is often at the point where it will not stay on after several hour of use since i do not always have a plug and charger with me i want some way to be able to recharge the battery i decided to give this unit a try along with a few i like about this unit the unit is small than my touch but a little bit thick still it is easy to carry in a shirt or pants pocket the unit is sleek and has an led readout that you can activate to check on the level of charge left on the battery the unit has a built in micro usb connect with a short cable that will allow you to charge device that utilize a micro usb the unit has enough capacity to recharge my ipod from an empty state to fully charged times before it is exhaust the unit easily recharge from any usb port you need to supply your own usb cable that can supply amp of current i use a seperate charger to charge my unit that has a capacity of amp the ipod charger cable apple connect on one end and usb on the other easily connect to this battery pack for charge the ipod there is a nice led light built into the unit that is activate by holding down the charge status button for seconds that turn on a nice white led light that is handy for times when you need a flash light turning it off is accomplished by holding down the same battery status button for two secondsi have also use this to recharge my cell phone use a special mil spec cord that convert a usb to a small plug sprint phone for the phone the battery pack is only capable of recharge it once from an empty that you must keep in mind with this battery pack this unit will only supply a of charge current if you have a device that require a higher charge rate you will have difficulty charge that device example the ipad require a a charge rate this unit require a a charge capable usb port some usb port are not capable of that level of current if yours is not this battery pack will charge very slow it is probably worth while to pick up a or amp usb charger i have a amp charger and it works greati would highly recommend this unit as long as your use demand fit the unit capabilities
3) external battery pack for apple ipad ipod and sanyo phone i received this unit from the manufacturer to test out with my ipad my two ipod and my sanyo cell phone mil spec unit each of these device require a volt dc charge supply so this volt power pack seem like the best of the directions and specification can be a bit confuse as the instruction are a translate however i find that the translate is fairly easy to understand if you just take a little extra timeone of the things you need to consider right up front is how large a battery pack you need and what charge rate you require the size of the battery pack affect how much of a charge you can put on a device and how often before it is deplete the charge rate affect how long it take to replace the charge on your device and whether it will charge at all a perfect example is the apple ipad require a amp charge rate if you plug it into a ma charger it will essentially not charge this battery pack is large enough to repower my cell phone many times my ipod times and is large enough to put a charge back on my ipad the second thing you need to know is that whatever the charge time is use your normal charger that is how long it is go to take with an external battery pack there are no shortcut here so if it take to hour to charge your ipad from a charge to a charge state use a charger that is how long it is go to take use an external battery pack that is size large enough for the battery pack has separate charge port a ma hour port and a a hour port that works well for my cell phone which use a ma charger and also for my ipad and my ipod which both use a a chargera many folks have comment on this battery pack come with a cable that has multiple tip that can be change out to fit multiple device the battery pack itself use a micro usb port to charge it with one of the supply tip my cell phone use a small narrow barrel charger one in the parts bag and my ipod and ipad use the standard apple connect also supply in the parts bag the unit also come with a a charger but i prefer use the a charger that the company sell separate it has a a and a ma charge port just like on this battery the battery recharge much fast use the a chargerone thing to note when you go to charger the battery the charge indicator lights will come on and will remain on during the charge cycle the number of lights that are on indicate the level of charge keep charge the battery for at least an hour after the th light come on since it come on when the battery is between and of all of my device work well you need to remember though that this battery will not fully charge an ipad from less than of charge it will replace of the battery capability the battery in the ipad is much large than the capacity of this charge battery from whatever point you connect it so if you are at it will recharge it to if you are at it will recharge it to one other option that you have is to just plug in this battery pack while you are use your ipad and use the capacity of it before you use up the capacity of your note you must press the battery status button once you connect the battery pack to your device to start the charge have use this battery extensive on all of the above device and it works exactly as it should it has never heated up on me and that is a real plus this battery pack definitely extend the useful time of your device and is great to have when there is no option for use regular ac power to recharge your devicei would highly recommend this unit the reason that the device earn four stars instead of stars is because of the number of loose parts for the cable and it do not have a storage bag to put them into
