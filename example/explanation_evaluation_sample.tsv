User ID	APPOPJ6Q3X5V5	Reviews	motorola h compact stylish and very comfortable current one of the only headset known to work well with the htc mogul i wear it all day and never run out of my charge and sometimes even forget that i am wearing it because it is so lighweight and comfortable amazon has top price on this product too i could buy two here for what id pay full retail elsewhere sound is clear on both my end and the receiver end great product and great value	great case for low price i like the fact that this case is clear so that it doesnt interfere with the color and looks of my phone yet it afford protection from scratch and drops price cannot be beat either the only complaint i could have and it isnt really the fault of this case is that the power button has such little travel that it is slightly difficult to depress for onoff the fact that the case is made of the gel substance though allow it enough give to press the button	great case for very reasonable amount the case is not too thick so it doesnt add a lot of bulk to an already large phone the onoff button is a little difficult to press sometimes but this is because of the design of the note and not the case the switch doesnt much so any case that would wrap around the edge is go to make it hard to press the onoff at least the material is a flexible gel for this case which allow for some give when depress the switchthe one thing i dislike about the case is the backside is not total clear which is what i want you can see in the picture the fancy s swirl on the back the left most portion of it has a frost look and is not completely see through i love the color of my titanium gray note and bought this case because it was describe as clear its still a really nice case and especially for the price but that remove a star for me	cruzerlite green androidify case normally as long as a case fit nicely and is decent look that is good enough for me that is until i picked up this cruzerlite green androidify tpu case off of amazon first this case is very nice look i love the green and the android guy on the back really make this case unique the fit is nice and snug and i really appreciate that the cutout are nicely cut ive had another tpu style case for my note and with it i had to press extra hard to push the onoff button with this cruzerlite case pressing the buttons is no long and issue to top it all off i think the price is really hard to beat especially considering the quality of the case itself for now on i will always look first to cruzerlite to supply my case needs i only wish i had done the buy two get one free special they have so many color option you can change them out base on your mood for the day	a great case that the casual observer cannot tell is on there my favorite part of this case is people telling me im brave not to be use a case it is unobtrusive yet the protection is there were talk a beautiful made phone that still looks beautiful yet im allow for a drop that can keep me from have a ding in that metal because ive got this case on it fit nice and snug and the price is unbeatable this will be a case model i look to in the future great for someone who take great care with their phone but needs the protection for the accidental drop

User ID	A3UCKRCOLRYKGP	Reviews	excellent charger with enough power to charge many device multiple times i have many mobile device and test this newtrent icarrier mah charger on all of them it charged the following galaxy note galaxy s iphone iphone g original iphone g original ipad and motorola sdhd bluetooth headset i charged my galaxy s note and iphone multiple times on a single icarrier come with a wall charger a soft pouch for storage a usb to microusb cable and a galaxy tab converter galaxy tab charge cable one note about this galaxy tab converter cable on the box it is describe as a galaxy tab converter cable however on the cable there is a sticker that describe it as a samsung galaxy tab charge cable i dont have a galaxy tab so i was unable to test this cablethe icarrier has two output label output and output output is va and output is va according to the manual the power onoff button has blue led use for various purpose which i will describe later in this review one thing i like about these led is that they arent too bright i have some device with blue led that are annoying bright not so for the the icarrier is connected to a power outlet the three led cycle from low mid to high indicate the icarrier is being charged when fully charged all three led stay lit while the power cable is connected once the power cable is disconnected the led go off and the device is power off if you power the device on the led will light up to indicate the current level of charge low mid or high after seconds the led will go off and the icarrier will power off if youre not charge anything during charge the power button led remains on to view the battery level while charge click the power button the battery level indicator led will light up for charge other device first turn on the icarrier by holding the power button down for about a second the icarrier has three blue led lit low mid and high that will indicate the current battery level of the icarrier connect your device to output and output you can charge multiple device at the same testi ran a special test with the ipad st generation since it has the largest battery of all my mobile device first i fully charged the icarrier and i fully deplete the battery on my ipad taking it down to next i disconnected the power supply from the icarrier turn it on then connected the ipad to output amp it took hour to fully charge the ipad i checked it every minutes the ipad gain every minutes with no variation until it was charged at this point the icarrier still show it had a mid chargei test charge the ipad while connected to output amp it charge even fast i was able to fully charge my ipad in hour minutes the battery level on the icarrier still indicate a mid charge linethi is a great little portable battery that can recharge just about anything with a usb cable it has a huge battery capacity with multiple charge port amp and amp i would recommend this to anyone	great case for the galaxy note this ionic guardian case offer great protection for your samsung galaxy note all edge are well protect its a twopiece case which fit together perfectly the first piece is a soft rubber the second piece is a hard plastic piece that fit over the rubber piece with hole and slot for some of the rubber to be expose which provide a better grip than just the plastic shell the four corner have rubber bumper that are slightly thick than the rest of the rubber offering better shock protection on the corner should you drop your note there is nothing covering the screen but the screen is made of gorilla glass so that may be sufficient for your needs also the rubber on the edge of the screen actually extend out approximate approx mm so there is some protection can charge the phone without taking off the case you can connect a headset without taking off the case also you dont have to deal with any flap covering the charge port or headset port which make it very convenientthe buttons on each side of the phone are cover with rubber buttons they work just fine no issue with any of the buttons being coveredthe only con i can think of is the soft rubber will gather pocket lint but just a little also for those who their screen to be cover with either a transparent plastic cover or transparent adhesive film this case do not have that	great case for those who just want a slim case that offer better grip the ringke slim soft feeling hard case is a very slim case that provide a much better grip than the bare galaxy note with no case it is very thin and allow you to slide the phone in and out of your pocket with ease another plus is that it do not gather pocket lint all port are easily accessible allow you to insert headphone or connect to a charger without taking off the casethe only con are that the protection for your phone is minimal the back is well protect since the case cover the back the side and corner are protect also the edge of the case extend out perhaps mm on either side of the phone providing a little protection to the front of the phone but the bottom and top of the phone are mostly expose	charge anything with a usb cable has a amp port and a amp port this new trent w va dual port charger impc will charge just about any device that has a usb cable i have many mobile device and test this new trent impc charger on all of them it charged the following galaxy note galaxy s iphone iphone g original iphone g original ipad blackberry curve and motorola sdhd bluetooth are two port for charge the bottom port is amp the top port must be amp note when i refer to the top and bottom port this is with the charger orient with the print wording on the case rightside up so you can read them properlythe charge amperage is not clearly marked on the device nor on the box i get different result charge different galaxy note can charge on both galaxy s can charge on both can charge on both curve only charge on bottom st generation only charge on the top portso depend on your device you may be able to use either port or just a single port for that device charge with the amp port will be fast than charge with the amp port i was able to charge multiple device at once with no issue charge times seem to be just as quick as oem chargersthe collapsible prong are a plus you can fold them in to save space when this an excellent wall charger the only improvement i could recommend would be to label the port so their power output could be more apparent

User ID	AHQRU3MRORIWQ	Reviews	blackberry curve case this is a good quality case for a very good price which say value to meother folk may have try to use this case with a phone other than the blackberry curve and so have not gotten good result from itfor a case that is not sold by blackberry which would have the device control magnet in it for example this is very good design this case hold my phone secure and pretty tight so the magnetic flap is just kind of an afterthought i prefer to lock the keyboard before putt in the case as i do not want it to pocket dial i am concerned that the side pieces might put too much pressure on the side buttons i have the version however those same side pieces allow the phone to stay secure while it is being use for phone or music play as it do not interfere with the headset jack i have use different defend case for blackberry curve series blackfor this phone and this one is a little classy look than the stock case i also usually keep my phone on vibrate and this case do not interfere with my being able to tell that is ring the clip is good in that it can attach to very wide belt i usually wear one that is inch wide and the clip can rotate so you can wear it perpendicular or parallel to your belt the logo is small and subtle so it is pretty basic which i like overall i think it hold the phone more secure than the stock clipthe box it come in is small and recycle the box that the small box came in was huge at least it was recycle	works well but not perfectly this device works fine while play media file and also use on my laptop it did not do so good while stream use window media player but that might have also been cause by the demand on my route at the time i test iti have a win tablet with builtin bluetooth a win laptop with usb bluetooth micro adapter a blackberry and it connect easily and works fine i am able to clip this to my shirt and leave my blackberry in my gym bag next to me while i work out and it works fine the earphone that come with it have a very short cord but you do not want a long one get in the way anywaythe earphone are also very good at block out noise i got this while it was on sale and am pleased with the value	a very fine pen for touch screen i have use device require styli for some time now and with the new device you can really wind up smear the screen or have a decrease in the accuracy this new stylus works just fine with compatible machine it is easy to use by people of any age	small but a smartphone that use bluetooth and also gps and wifi the demand on the battery are greater than ever throw in that winter is coming and at least around here you never know if you will be without power at home or stuck on train or bus without a power outlet for who know how longthi device charged my blackberry while it was on from to in about an hour after the first time it take about three hour to charge it fully it has little led that show the charge small and light about half the size of a blackberry has standard connect micro usb to charge it standard usb to supply power and can charge pretty much any small portable device with its own cable that use usb power it is also sold by belkin who has a good price point seem high as of date of review many other device offer either more features or greater capacity for the price do not come with its own charger so you have to charge it with a computer or with a charger you have from another devicei suggest that a higher capacity device or one with more features would be a better use of your money	very near perfect headset it come with very good noisereduce headphone but since it has a standard connect on it you can use other one the included headphone have a very short cord so it wont get in your way use the chain or clip you can hide it or show it off as you wish the battery wont last forever but it do last a pretty long time the sound quality of the music is excellent the audio quality on the other end of a phone conversation may not be the best so i would not use it for a long or important conversation it do pause the music while you are on a call so that pretty nice i have use it with a blackberry nextel blackberry curve i cell phone a lg cosmos lg cosmos phone verizon wireless and my laptop with a bluetooth usb bluetooth micro adapter gbu and it works very well with eachi like use it while at the gym because it can seal out the noise and the music they play on the loudspeaker and leave my phone in my gym bag on the floor i use the chain and the clip just in case i accidental knock it off my shirt the buttons are big than on some device like the clipper bluetooth stereo headset and it is nice to have separate one for volume playpause track backforward and onoff phone the chain has a link that looks very much like the old bead chain connect so if it get caught on something you might have chance to get it off before you choke if you only use the chain it has a tendency to get in the way if you want to use the water fountain it is a good device to use while wearing like in the winter or in the it with a new device is easy and even the indicator light show different colors and flash depend on what you are try to do with it it also use a standard miniusb jack for charge it come with a wallcharger which is on the bottom of the device but it do not have a cover so i do not really know how weatherresistant it isso even though it is about the sizeweight of a ipod nanosize mp player you cant take phone call on one of those like you can on this i like this device better than my jabra clipper i only wish it had voice prompt instead of beep and				fun this product is fun but not particularly be warn that it has the mm four conductor stripe plug on it which might not fit your phone and an adapter can be hard to nokia mm jack to mm handsfree adapter ad is one i think may work but i didnt get one so im not sure i have one phone that can use this and one phone that cannot i dont think that the sound is impressive considering that you get better sound and features from a bluetooth headset street bluetooth stereo headset bluetooth headset retail package black othersif you want to cradle this handset on your shoulder while you use your smartphone that fine but you probably already have a headset or handsfree device anyway and if you dont then you should so this is really just a toy sorry	first new idea ive seen in a while this product is really great new take on bluetooth headset you dont have to wear it in your ear all the timeyou can clip it to your clothes or use the short lanyard to wear it like a necklace and it flash and vibrate to alert you to a call you then pull the earpiece and cord out and stick it in your ear while the microphone stays close to your mouth it has pretty large buttons so it is easy to use with glove on so it may be a help during the preference is for stereo earbud or a speakerphone but if all you need is a headset this is a good choice	the best bluetooth headphone so far pro small and battery lifea sturdy storage case is included micro usb to find function button to both various size plug and external ear fin and overtheear hook that keeps these in your ear when you are is better than any of the jabra bluetooth headphone i lightcon tiny print in the out from time to time if your source device is too far from the headsetthi audio quality is very very good i have been look for a set like this for a long timeyou do have to follow their instruction and keep your bluetooth device on the same side as the receiver	compact and portable i have use a verizon g wifi hotspot from time to time and it usually was able to make a g connection which was much fast than g so i have had some experience use these device with tablet and laptop use those hotspot really draw the battery down very fastthi device is fairly compact a bit big than a pack of large play cards i have not had a problem with the battery life it met my expectations it is better if you are not in a moving vehicle if you need a reliable connection because you may have your connection drop while go between cell you can control the device name and password setting up the service with att is quick and easy if you are go to be use it while travel be sure to set your service before you go and check the coverage map to see if you can expect to have service the wifi connection distance is about the same as with a regular route i didnt specifically try to set it up with the different wifi standard but it is supposed to be b g n enable it do appear to go into sleep mode when you do not have device use it i did not have enough device to see if i could max it out but only smartphone and laptop	nearperfect for me pro stylish like the street voice and light notification of function listen to news and traffic or music with the fm radio while still being able to take or make phone call i have had a bit of a problem with reception of my favorite radio station but i think that is the transmitter problem not the headset problem judge from the reception i have with my other radio on my desk i also to not really expect it to work with station that are far away it is essentially a pocket radio receiver and not something with a large antenna it has acceptable performance as a handsfree phone device the option to use any standard earphone is great too as always have a microusb charger included is wonderful as is not have to lug around a unique charge device no problem connect with my lg cosmos phone like other bluetooth headphone you can wear these and keep your expensive device hidden away from envious eyes or grab hand on a subway etccon the combination necklace earphone cord tend to make the earbud pull out of my ear a bit more often than i would likea a commuter i use this every day this is a nearperfect device for me	emergency power this device could really help you out if you need it in a pinch if you have no other way to power your iphone this could save your life i will definitely keep one of these with probably at least one more battery in our emergency kit as long as we have one or more device that can use it	sweet this device has a lot of energy to charge all your portable device it charged my blackberry bold from half to full in less than an hour with plenty to spare the only thing that i dont like is that it do not have a cover for the outlet so that you have to put it inside of something else to keep from get lint in it	slim and sweet this case is small and light but it do add some bulk to your phone because it has space for a few cards and a little fold cash however it is small than a phone in a case and also a wallet with the same amount of stuff in it together in your pocket	light this headset is light and has nice ear insert fit my ear well and is comfortable enough to wear all daythe portable case charger will keep the charge can place the earpiece in the charger and then attach the charger to a standard microusb charger and charge them both at the same timeyou dont need tool of destruction to get the package can listen to things other than the phone with the headsetthe app can help you find the headset if you misplace it and it will flash the light and make pretty loud can delete the app if you need to and the headset will still workthe audio on my side is pretty had to install the app before my phone would recognize the the sound on the caller end is good and sometimes do not include as many left side ear insert as right side	fine lightweight case this case will protect your phone from some light damage i would not count on it to protect your device from anything highimpact i would prefer to trust my device to an otterbox it is a hybrid case in the it is part hard plastic and part soft plastic although it is difficult to tell from the photo	pro vs regular i have use a verizon g wifi jetpack hotspot from time to time and it usually was able to make a g connection which was much fast than g so i have had some experience use these device with tablet and laptop use those hotspot really draw the battery down very fastthi device is fairly compact a bit big than a pack of large play cards i have not had a problem with the battery life it met my expectations it is better if you are not in a moving vehicle if you need a reliable connection because you may have your connection drop while go between cell you can control the device name and password setting up the service with att is quick and easy if you are go to be use it

didnt specifically try to set it up with the different wifi standard but it is supposed to be b g n enable it do appear to go into sleep mode when you do not have device use it i did not have enough device to see if i could max it out but only smartphone and laptop i dont have stat on it but it seem to work slow than the verizon unit i have had to reboot the device during a long session but i have also had to do that with the jetpack i reside in an area that has very good to the pro version it has phone battery boost if your phone is running low sometimes you might tap the wrong thing if you are use the touchscreen so you might try a stylus if you need to it do have very nice and clear screen otherwise connection for up to device advertise as oppose to the regular version which is only i would get whichever of the two device offer the best plan or price since i really dont expect to have more than device running off of it	a good little alternative the symmetry by otterbox is a very nice alternative to the generally bulky defend it do not have a screen protector which some people will like but it is all one piece which make it easy to take off when you want to use a dressy case for a night outit could be improve with the addition of the bottom port plug like the commuter and it is kind of a drag that you are stuck with the color combinations that otterbox choose for you but all in all a nice balance of style and protectionit is slim and sleek and will let your iphone fit in a pocket unlike a defend series case that you pretty much have to wear on your belt	perfectly pink wall charger the charger works perfectly which have found that all belkin product do i test the ac wall charger and i received the pink one and that is good because it make it easy to find or at least not lose it there is also less of a chance that one of our son will borrow it and not return it works perfectly with my iphone s	jabra rox the wireless headphone this product is most like the jaybird do allow for you to take a phone call but the quality is not that great it is not really design for use as a handsfree device in the car they block out noise from outside not enough to comfortable block the sound of my lawnmower but are useful for block out the noise and the music they play at the gym for the regular bluetooth on my iphone and nfc bluetooth android work easily and fast charge is done easily as the left side earbud has a magnetic latch on the door as oppose to just a little piece of plastic like most product of this type since i wear glasses of sunglasses prefer to have earphone that are inside my ear instead of do have an app it can help you control the sound but i did not notice much change in the effects you can use this same app for other jabra product these earphone might take a little fiddling with to get a good snug fit you may have to change both the size of the piece that go in the ear canal and the little wings that attach to the speaker part however it the whole system is pretty light and not annoy to wear i like the little control box that is near the right side earphone i think it is easy to use than little tiny buttons on the earphone think that jabra has very lightweight yet versatile product here that has upp the ante in the wireless headphone game

User ID	A1VTV7GXWSGJ3E	Reviews	great sound easy set up i have recently start use gb gps fitness track and music a device to help motivate my exercise routine while i wasnt overly impress with that device at first i have become a little more enthuse with it almost note almost to the point of bump my rating for it from three stars to four have said that the headset that came with the unit is a bit annoy great sound but it is frustrate to have that connected wire from the player to the headset while youre running so when i had the opportunity to try a wireless set i jump at itthe motorola sf is an easy sell for me excellent sound wireless and a very easy setup up of course it connected immediately to the fitness track had to try a couple of times but it connected with my blackberry torch fairly easily as well the headset come with a number of different size of ear gel so you can pick the best size to keep the speaker snug if i have one complaint it doesnt appear to have a battery life indicator when the battery is get low the little motorola experience guide flyer that come with the headset do say to charge fully before each use so i guess youre to plug it in between im very impress with the head set comfortable great sound and set up quick and easily i was rock with it with five minutes of opening the box what more can you ask for	not impress and over price too many issue make this a bluetooth headset to and to me most important the sound is horrible very tinny sound which make it hard to understand anyone especially if there is an accent involved if its not functional in this manner what is the point in use itsecond its cheap plastic that has in a way that doesnt really fit the ear well ive use head set from a number of manufacturer and although very few are a perfect fit most are workable not this onethird its over price maybe at or less maybe but not at an price tag just not worth itpersonal opinion pass on this one	functional as a relatively new smart phone user i am surprise at how fragile they are i remember the days when if you drop your cell phone you had as much a chance of chipping the tile as break the phone not today now its almost like if you look at it wrong the screen was the case with the iphone as we broke one due to lack of coordination so we just got the new iphone and have found it to be thinner and it seem to be more fragile obviously a protective case is require we chose this one only because of the brand name and the color it fit perfectly and actually do seem to protect the phone i know this as weve already had one episode of and it it is functional what else can you say about a rectangular piece of plastic with a clear plastic face	good sound and relatively inexpensive but has an interesting definition of wireless i just received my jabra play bluetooth stereo headset and came away both impress but scratch my head at the same time ive try a few different wireless headset including themotorola sflex hd wireless stereo bluetooth headset retail package sf wireless sports headphone black bulk and exercise freak inear headphone the jabra play bluetooth stereo headset over all is a decent wireless headsetfirst the good very easy set up it seriously took about seconds as my unit came already with a charge the sound quality is outstanding when play music from a device it also accept voice command when you want to call out click the onoff bottom and speak either call or call my recommendation is to use the number option as when i spoke my wife name it try to call someone in my contact list whose name is somewhat similar kind that is a nice feature if youre exercisingthe notsogood ok technical it is a wireless devise in that its not connected to your phone ipad car etc however the ear phone are wire into a small device that you clip on your clothes somewhere the ear bud have long wire for this and in my opinion kind of take away the wireless advantage all the other wireless headset ive use are attach only to each earpiece no other wire need add to that the earpiece do not have a piece that keep the earpiece snug in your ear so they tend to shake loose if you are do strenuous activity lastly while the stereo sound for music is awesome the sound for phone call is extremely tinny sound when i call my wife she said i sound like i was inside a tin canoverall its not a bad device especially at this price point its functional and has a nice voice command aspect to it but the lack of being a true wireless device even if it do connect via bluetooth in my opinion lessen the appeal for me ill probably stick with the motorola sf wireless sports headphone for now

User ID	A33JGP7NR4BV8W	Reviews	a nice bluetooth this is only my third bluetooth i had given up on them in years past because theyve traditional been so loud and just not worth it i had been use the white cord earbud that came with my iphone but i thought this sound was much easy to setup than previous bluetooth headset i have own i have to give it five stars for ease of setup the battery is powerful and i can go a week without charge it grant im not very chatty i love the adorable little charger and i like that design of this headset its not gaudy or sound is definitely improve over prior bluetooth headset i have own but this headset is loud its a little too loud for me even on the quietest setting i have no hearing damage and i like things quiet in general so this might be fine for most people but i find it a bit husband and friends say they can hear me very well on this although my year old mother complain its too muffle she prefer my white iphone earbud but when i use those i have to hold the mic near my mouth so she can hear me so i think its only real complaint is that the headset is not very comfortable i will put it in to make a call but its definitely not a device for me my ear is a little too small for this earbud it is uncomfortable for me for more than minutes or so	so far so good my year old has had this on his new ipod touch for about a week now and its holding up really well it was easy to install and there were few air bubble to squeegie out than many other screen protector i have applied to device over the years	for the price should include the wall charger pro i like the power button that show whether it has a charge and how much charge is left i like the versatile that we can use it with different product we have so many in our family i like that it hold a good amount of power and will charge my for the price i would have expect this item to come with a wall plug for the microusb power input i was able to use my iphone wall outlet with a standard usbusb cord but it just seem to me if you have a dedicated microusb input that you could include a wall adapter for that microusb input when there an price tagthe unit arrive with only one battery light still lit which make me think the power off button doesnt really prevent the battery from drain even though the literature say its not supposed to drain when off time will tell how long this hold a charge and i will update this review in a few it do hold a charge well and it do charge my device its nice and lightweight comparatively i have a small pouch i keep it in which doesnt take up much room in my thing that annoy is it has taken one of my iphone lightning cords it simply wont let go im afraid if i pull any hard it will ruin the cord and the battery pack so its now only suitable to charge new apple device	very attractive i love the look and feel of this cover the stand has only a few position but they are good angle i do wish there was an elastic strap so it was more secure when i want to hold it like a book it fit well in the corner bracket but i do prefer the type of case that protect all the way round the edge	seem to work as intended i got this case because i want the iphone protect from the sort of abuse a year old boy can dish out were not plan on taking it scuba dive or any thing like that but we did want protection from accidental drops into puddle and from the sand that somehow always accumulate in a year old boys pocketso far the phone seem well protect i havent found any sand get into the case which is great because sand can be really the other military grade case we have use on iphone over the years there is a bit of a loss of quality for sound and pictures its not tremendous and no worse than the griffin defend i had on my iphone or the otterbox i have on my other iphone same with photo very slightly lower quality in lower light situation like the griffin case my otterbox doesnt cover my camera lensthe screen cover is fine certainly as good as the griffin im use to of course a screen cover is not go to have a display that as brilliant as a naked iphone but then a naked iphone is very please with the lower profile this case has its much easy to put this phone in a pocket i also like the construction as its easy to deal with than the twolayer silicone and hard plastic casesso yes there are slight concession in appearance call quality and photo quality but in my opinion its no worse than their competitor and is the price you pay for protection				works very well this is a great little battery pack i was recently travel with my iphone and was drain the battery very quick this would have been very handy to extend battery lifeit works perfectly it charge quick and it recharge my iphone pretty quick or at least fast than i can drain it when play games its a little small and heavy than the iphone so it still fit in my purse very easily the color is really pretty it seem durable enough i have already drop it despite the noslip coating that is on it but it still works perfectly the flashlight is a handy bonus too until apple learn to put a better battery in their iphone ill be grateful to have this as a backup it also works to charge my nd generation ipadi have no complaint about itwe just took it on a short vacation to a family our battery on our phone were die quick because cell service was really spotty in our area and the phone seem to be working hard to find and maintain a signal a couple of us were use it to replenish our iphone during the day and we never got it below charge we charged it back up at night it was really convenient	do what it is supposed to do pro i like have a spot on my nightstand where i can just put my phone down and trust it to charge without have to fumble in the dark for the charge cord my husband almost always go to sleep before i do and have this to use as a charge mat is very convenient my phone is always fully charged when i wake up in the nice to have as a battery backup if im go to be running around all day without access to my car chargercon its very expensive for what it do i dont think its a good value and the price needs to fall significant for me to recommend it to most people you can get a backup battery pack much more get really warm when charge i dont think its likely to start a fire but i do think all of that extra heat is just waste electricity which is waste i dont want to pay for electricity that disappear in the form of hot electronicsthe charge case doesnt come with it which i think is really absurd in addition the charge case has design problem that make it unattractive for daily use

User ID	ANV8JY8QA4L0L	Reviews	adequate bluetooth headset i choose this headset for the price and because samsung has a good reputation for quality product i gave it an okay rating because the headset is easy to use and set up it connect quick with a blackberry smart phone where i was not impress was with the sound quality is adequate but the volume needs to have a wide range and noise cancellation in a windy environment is not good you and the person on the other end of the phone both here the wind noise to the extent that it forces you to turn it off and talk directly into the phone could use better noise and wind cancellation	great for ipad and smartphone user great help on ipad and smart phone with the electronic keyboard help to quick hit the correct key and avoid that big finger mistake	great auto charger for samsung galaxy siii great charger for your galaxy device cord is long enough to use any plug in location in your car but also coil so it isnt hanging all over or get in the way well made device better than expect from write up deliver quick and in good package	adequate charger expect a superior device from verizon cord is short than need package look like it was a resale of the device

User ID	APBDZ88BBTN4F	Reviews	hand down the best earbud headset i have ever own the blackberry original stereo headset which i ordered here on amazon and which was sent to me by cellular star is exactly the headset that i have always want for my blackberryi listen to my blackberry all day i listen to music and news podcast mps on it while commute at the gym at work etc i prefer a wire headset to make call as well all i care about is that i can hear the sound from them and that i dont lose sound in one ear and that the volume carry well that all i care about from the audio from my mobile phone and these perform headset has a nice thick cord which resist all attempt at tangle and crimp the leading cause of lose the sound in one earbud the bud themselves are well craft and fit in the ear well and come with small medium and large pad to fit your ear the connect is a right angle plug and the jack is a mm format exactly what my blackberry curve call i am most likely go to stock up on these as i go through headset like they are on fire	average in pretty much every way and can only be worn in an annoy way i have been use the jabra clipper bluetooth stereo headset for a few week now give it a fair shot now i am read to review ita a bluetooth device it perform adequate compare to holding the handset up to the ear or use directly wire headphone with a microphone the bluetooth microphone and stereo headset combo provide muddle voice quality and flat tone and no bass when i speak to someone who is also use a bluetooth device i have to ask them to repeat themselves often and they me when i use the handset directly or a directly wire setup i can hear them ok and they can hear me greata a music device it has the same sound problem additional if you place the phone in a back pocket prepare to lose signal quality repeatedly you also cannot be anywhere near a microwave when it is running or anything else running on the same frequency the sound is flat and sound like it is coming from further away than normal i try the cheap very cheap headphone they include with the device and higher quality one the higher quality one from sennheiser did make a difference and ramp up the quality from about a to about a on a point the plus side not have a wire go from my phone to my ear is a real bonus when driving and when at the gym i cannot tell you how many set of headphone i have had to replace because i have snag a wire and damage the that bonus is offset by the clipper nature of the device it is not a hinge clip it is more like a which means unless you wear a shirt or a shirt with a pocket on the front you can clip it on to then you are go to be left with few option to clip it to shirt collar is pretty much the only other consistent option and to clip it you basically have to force it to slide on to whatever you are try to clip it to because you cannot pry or wedge it open to get it to slide easy because if you do according to the instruction manual it will stay wedged open and lose the ability to clip tight at alloverall it is an average product with a mechanism for wearing it that is emptor	not bad i have review another jabra product before thejabra clipper bluetooth stereo headset and i didnt care for it i felt the sound and call quality of that product was average at bestthi product however is not too shabby at all it is now my official backup set of headphone i keep in the car on the off chance i forget my main setthe sound isolate earbud work well the cord is long enough the cord isnt frail prone to crimp or overly stiff the microphone pick up voice very well cant say much about their wind resistant claim i dont think any microphone without an actual wind screen can actually do much about thatso why not stars two reasonsthe plug is a straight plug not a degree angle plug that means it sticks straight out from the device and since my device is a blackberry and the mm jack is on the upper left side that means it create a problem for putt the phone into my normal pocket i carry it in when use this headsetthe clip that come with the cord is flimsy and doesnt stay in position welloverall this is a decent product i notice no better sound from it than i do from my rim blackberry official headphone but it is certainly no worse than those headphone either stars	not bad not great but not bad i had never heard of francoi et mimi as an electronics maker before i got these headphone so either they are new or they are so niche that they have remain under my radar until now base on my experience with their product though i would wager they are newthe ld headphone i have been test for several week now work fairly well and you could certainly do a lot worse i successful made phone call with them although where and why i would ever be wearing full headphone to make call with i could not even begin to guess at and i successful pair them with my phone and computer to play audio over i list to both music and game audio which came through all rightso why the stars well to begin with the unit is light and plasticy i dislike electronics that feel cheap and plastic additional the earcup are thin and oddly shaped and the padding on the top of the band is almost nonexistent also they use the cheap pleather instead of leather which feel like putt a pair of ear muff over my head after just a few minutes get hot the band is also difficult to adjust you have to use a reasonable amount of force while you are connected and the unit is on you will constant hear a buzz background noise through the set and finally the control are also not that great the pair process in particular is irksome why do so many device manufacturer insist on multifunction buttons where you hold them down for different length of time or press them in different pattern and length instead of just providing separate buttons for separate job the cost difference cannot be that unit overall is fine and get the job done but so many have come before it with superior quality product i am thinking in particular of unit from logitech and turtle beach and this unit from this unknown manufacturer doesnt do anything to stand out to me so while there isnt anything major wrong with these headphone you could do a lot worse there isnt anything major right with them either they are just average stars	not bad theduracell powermat gopower to have a mah capacity so i decided to test it in a real world situation normal people with normal batterypowere device generally do not need access to an battery pack during the day either their device can be charged at home in the car at work on a break etc or their device can make it through the hour they are out of the house for work or school or whatever i have found that when i need and want these type of things is when i am travel specifically travel by air or train and when in a hotel which never have enough power outlet seriously hotel industry they are call power strip look into them so i setup the parameter for my test i charged the unit to full capacity the night before and then i let it sit for about hour typical preparation below are the result of my summary for busy people on the go successful held the battery level steady while use kindle fire hd new model for charged kindle fire hd new model from charge to in roughly hour drain about of the charged samsung galaxy exhibit from to in roughly hour drain about of the capacitythe device was able to successful charge mah worth of power in a real world test set of circumstancesthe device should have a builtin charge cablethe device is rather of my test i took the unit and connected it to mykindle fire hd with mah battery while i was play a game at full bright and cpu level normally when i play a game the battery is discharge at a steady rate of about every minutes or so with the device plug into the duracell powermat though i was able to hold steady at the battery percentage it was showing for about minutes before it dip i play until the device dip and then shut everything off this was my of try to top up while wait in an of my test i let the unit sit for about hour while i also use my kindle until it was down to of power at that point i turn the kindle completely off and plug it into the duracell powermat this was to simulate recharge while in a plane on a long trip it took a total of hour and minutes for the duracell powermat to charge the kindle all the way back to i checked it periodical to see how it was do below is my data from the test am kindle at power turn off powermat show led for power indicator pm kindle at power turn on but screen off except to check status powermat show led for power indicator pm kindle at power turn on but screen off except to check status powermat show led for power indicator pm kindle at power turn on but screen off except to check status powermat show led for power indicator pm kindle at power turn on but screen off except to check status powermat show led for power indicator pm kindle at power turn on but screen off except to check status powermat show led for power of my test with the kindle back up to full charge i switch to charge my phone asamsung galaxy exhibit with mah battery this was to charge phone at hotel or in car or train ride post airport again on a long journey the phone was at of battery charge when i plug it in to the powermat at pm i checked it periodical until it was at it reach at pm there was still led showing on the power level indicator on the were not strict scientific test but they are certainly ballpark test and i try to simulate real world conditions when i ran the test bottom line the duracell powermat gopower longhaul claim to have a mah capacity i can say with certainty that in real world conditions it has at least mah add to that the minutes i use it to hold the battery level steady on the kindle during play and the times between use and i would say you can easily expect to get at least a solid mah out of this thing during real world conditions you may be able to get mah out of it under ideal circumstances but given the charge times i encounter for my device even if i was charge at a time which is possible with duracell powermat i would find it unlikely that you would be in a situation without access to a wall charger long enough even in ideal circumstances to get mah out of the unit before circumstances if you are go to be go on a long journey or be in a situation for a long time without access to power to charge your device maybe all day in a jury room you certainly want a unit like this with you it will basically double your phone tablet longevity if i was go to improve this device i would make at least one charge cable built into the device instead of have to be carry separate i would also try to get the device small i know that is hard to do with the size of the battery it has to have to have the capacity it has but i would still try it is quite bulky to carry around in a pocket it is a good device though and work well under the test conditions i put it under stars

from their bluetooth enable get one awesome little device	loud and clear jabra cruiser incar speakerphone is a nifty little device and works pretty well in both of my car i attempt it first in my ford focus which is less noisy than my other ford gt and i am pleased to say that this incar speakerphone has perform pretty well in both of our caller on the other side report that i was coming thru loud and clear and very little background noise mainly due to the noise blackout dual microphone that this device has in each side of the unit i attempt this with an unlock cell phone with mpvideo player microsd version with warranty which has excellent speakerphone capabilities but i still need to with the keypad to get its speakerphone to work with jabra cruiser incar speakerphone now i can talk without have to touch my cell phonethe advertise feature that it will download your phonebook and tell you who is calling to the speakerphone did not work and when a call came in the lovely female voice say call from number rather than speak its name which is what i expect however i feel it is due to the fact that i have a very old nokia cell phone which may not have the cool features of the high tech new cell jabra cruiser perform nicely it fit perfectly on the visor and the builtin speaker is loud and clear the coolest part is that it can stream music via the fm transmitter agree that most of the fm frequency are occupy where i live but it is easy to change the frequency to a band that is not in use by a local fm station and change the same on the car radio for clear reception default to mhz but can be change by select a new fm frequency enter fm mode by pressing the fm button press volume up button until searching is announce when a new frequency is found and announce tune your car radio manual into the same fm frequency the jabra speakerphone will automatic save the new the way a tap on the volume upvolume down button will change the frequency on the jabra speakerphone

select prefer language and press fm button until the new language is battery life seem pretty good but as with any battery operate device you must use it for couple of month to get the true use capacity also it is true with any device which has lie battery never leave the device inside the car when it is too hot or too cold inside the car it can premature damage the batteryi personally think that it a good product and very easy to use and sad thing is that now you will have to take the phone call when you are driving good product remember any distraction is fatal so please drive safe	super voice quality motorola hx looks great works great sound great pair super easily and has an excellent background noise cancellation use the dual microphone along with the crystal talk tm technologythe included ear option works very well for my ear and i am sure it will be fine for most user as you have on your ear inear with an ear hook or inear without a hooki love the automate voice guidance given during pair i have not heard this feature in any other bluetooth device before it make pair simple and fast for anyone the automate female voice also let you know the battery level without have you to look at the led light to find the battery levelthe buttons are placed in appropriate place for volume and love the power flip motorola unique rapid connect feature let you handle call with just a flip simply flip open to turn on and talk flip closed to turn off and save power it is better than onoff switch and looks cool when fold the hx is even small than expectedit is lightweight and very comfortable to wear did i mention the voice and call quality is excellent i try it at work in very noisy server room and also in my old ford car driving at freeway speed the party on the other side of the line was able to hear me clearly and i was able to hear the party loud and clear i am truly impress by this product voice quality i do not have an android phone to try the voice to text and vice versa feature use motospeak app to dictate text handsfree and to hear text read through your headset but even without that app when pair with my age nokia and samsung eternity cell phone voice quality result were excellent which made me a happy recommend use hand free device while you are driving is a law in most states get one and please drive safe	overprice quirky i got this product for review from amazon and i have been test it for past few days the product itself is useful in emergency situation wherein you do not have ac power source to charge your smartphone or tablet it do charge an average smartphone from fully discharge state to full battery charge may be and half times maximum before die out it can also charge big ipad tablet or inch samsung tablet too from zero to about charge capacity before die out which is not too bad in emergency situationsthe tylt powerplant came fully charged when you press the button all the led lights up but as soon as you start use the powerplant the led lights start acting up it drops from led full power to about led in less than min after that it show led when you press the button it do keep charge despite this led display weird till the powerplant battery is really come the problem tylt powerplant do not come with its own charger so you will have to use your own for example use it to charge from a usb port on your pc well that where i ran into issue i use the included charge cable and attempt it to charge on a regular pc port and nothing happen no lights nothing i start to investigate the issue and found that the device was attempt to draw too much current exceed ma so my pcs usb port would shutdown so i attempt it on a a car cigarette lighter port base usb charger and that too had issue wherein it would detect overload and start to believe that tylt powerplant was dead but i still could not convince myself how a perfectly working electronics can go from fully working to completely dead short by merely discharge completely to an attach device which it was design for and go dead hmmm fishy quirky indeed thanks to many other a or higher usb charger and converter that are lie around in my house i start to attempt to kick start this tylt powerplant one by one after about attempt it came back to life finally use kindle fire usb charger which is a wherein the green led start to blink indicate that it is charge the internal battery it took almost hour before the green led power off indicate a full chargethi lead me to conclude that if you ever fully discharge the tylt powerplant as intended the charge circuit draw too much initial current to recharge the internal battery thereby overload a regular usb port some low power usb charger you need to connect to a a or higher usb power charger to rejuvenate the device back to normal this also explain why some people has comment that it stop working after few month of of the story do not fully discharge your tylt powerplant the other reason for my star rating is the price imho there are better alternative out for reading my review				designer delight this is the first smart pen that i have ever own and i was super excited to try this out with my wife ipad rd generation as the equil jot smart pen current works only on apple ios platform an android app is not yet out but is expect by mid of the first thing i did was to pair the equil jot with the ipad via bluetooth and it prompt me to install app from apple app store there are two app that are current available that you must install on ipad to use the equil jot smart pen the ios app go by the name and both these app are free on apple app store from a company known as co ltd once you have these app install you are now ready to use equil jot smart penthe main sell point from the manufacturer is that the product will be compatible with any type of paper and that is exactly what i did i just use a stack of a size white sheet on a flat surface placed the bluetooth transceiver on top of the stack fire up the ios app on my wife ipad pressed the button on the pen and start to write as you would normally do on regular paper and i saw my scribble instantly get digitize on the ios i know that i am not an artist nor i am a designer but i could clearly see the potential of this innovate product use this product it can be super easy for anyone who wish to digitize their thought on the fly transfer creative drawing to digital format instantly and share it with anyone use email or save it to the cloud for later the app design for ios are very good they have plethora of option like brush size brush color layer base edit option like add pictures in your sketch undo redo lock and unlock page etc the app are really good making a fine compliment to the product and motivate you to be use this product for few days i realize that this product oblivious is not for everyone while it faithfully digitize everything that you write or draw on regular paper the only problem i do see is fact that the and or must be running in the foreground on your ios device and your iphone or ipad must be power on not in standby next to you and within the bluetooth range for this smart pen to function this can be a major problem for some people who would like to use this smart pen without use and active ios devicethi equil jot smart pen device do not have any builtin storage of any sort and your note or sketch cannot be transfer at an later point this is the only negative aspect of this product there is another company by name livescribe and achieve this feat and much more but again you have to use their special far as consume are concerned the lithium battery use in the bluetooth transceiver pen can be recharge use regular usb port and works well for the entire day the black ball point tip can also be replace the product come with one extra refill but you can also c refill a substitute till manufacturer start sell their own the product works as advertise and i am rating this with stars one star was deduct as you need to have your ios device and equil app running for this smart pen to for reading my review	good quality micro usb car charger this is a very good quality micro usb car charger for android and compatible device with amp power output from a reputable companyi attempt this with multiple device that accept micro usb as the charge port and all of them readily accept the power output given by this universal car charger with amp current output my phone motorola android base my tablet kindle fire and kindle ebook reader all accept the charge without any fuss even couple of my sony camera accept this charger as well this one charger in your glove box will come handy for multitude of device when need the unit do not get too hot when compare to most other brand i have use before which clearly tell me that the power conversion circuit inside this charger is efficient and not some cheapo linear ic with oddball resistor the amazon price on this is very competitive the best thing about this charger versus most other similar product from other manufacturer is that it come with its own coil cord and micro usb port which means less clutter in your glove is also sell a model with lightning connect for new apple this one lightning car charger for iphone ipad and ipod amp output apple quality product why take risk from unknown brand with your expensive tablet and phone five stars

User ID	A1A19CGIZ8IUFI	Reviews	excellent portable battery with one flaw this unit has been very good its one flaw it deliver approximate of rate capacity i still do not understand the widespread use of overly optimistic rating in the field of external mobile battery device when other industry seem to rate their battery to correct capacity i have several radio control helicopter and airplane and i buy and build my own battery pack all of the good quality battery i have use have deliver their rate capacity or better the ntt also has a great form factor and is reasonably light for the state capacity what set this device apart is the ability to charge three device at once the integrated usb and micro usb cords are one of the best features on any mobile battery and i do not know why it has not been implement on many more of these device it is very handy to not have to carry or search for a usb charge cable the four led lights that display capacity are not very accurate most of the capacity is deliver by the halfway indication of two lights i find that with two lights out of four left the battery has much less than half the capacity this is one thing i would ask manufacturer to do and that is to design better charge remain indicator as it is the new trent ntt is one of the best mobile battery pack i have test	great lightweight stand this is a really great lightweight stand the construction and material are very good throughout and the design is excellent	defective i did purchase two other otg cable from two other place and they both work properly so this one is defective the seller was very good about helping me and offering to replace it but time ran out on my return window my fault	great alternative to high price oem the bottom line is this do exactly what it is supposed to no more no less the capacity is a true mah it works every bit as well as the more expensive oem from any carrier	great car mount this thing sticks like glue any where i put it it is much more solid than my old one which wiggle around a lot quality design and material throughout this is the best				slick design 	the best as always i have these on my s and my note they are the best i have use i will continue to use and recommend the spigen protector	another excellent anker product anker is spoil me this battery is as good or better than the stock battery for so much less and so far customer service what more do you want more stuff	best portable battery i have use test of powerpak ultra new trent powerpak ultra is an excellent portable battery it deliver a greater percentage of its rate capacity to recharge device than any other portable power supply i have testedthe form factor is very good but not great the thickness interfere with ultimate portable and the weatherproof while arguable useful add bulk and weight for in my opinion a poor tradeoff there is no doubt that the package is rugged and durable but the device must be protect like any other while it is in use for some this will have value but i would rather have less weight and small sizein all this is one of the very best portable power solution available on the market at this time it deliver on its promise of capacity rugged and weatherproof which is a breath of fresh air in a market that and the value for your money is extremely high i cannot recommend the new trent powerpak ultra highly enough to those who require extra durable and environmental resistance it has little or no real competition in its price class or level of qualitymy final rating of the new trent powerpak ultra ntrb is an easy stars out of form trent have create the maximum protection in the minimum space and weight corner are nicely round and the rubbery side afford a very good grip without add features that are unnecessary new trent have add exactly what is need and nothing more to create rugged and waterproof i have seal the port cover on this as direct and submerge the powerpak ultra in of water for hour and there was no detect leakage this battery is great for people that are in wet and muddy environment that will be able to use it for charge in a more control environment remember that when you open a port cover to charge a device the water resistance is gone i travel a lot in my job on foot and by public transport my battery stay either in my scottevest or my waterproof backpack so my personal perspective may be different from yours nevertheless i still feel that it is a bit large and a bit heavy i use my scottevest jacket all the time and this power supply do not fit well into the space i report weight is ounce and i have measured it at rate capacity is mah i always approach rate capacity with great skepticism when these type of device first came out in the s i found the actual deliver capacity very close to the rate capacity in recent years there are very many of these portable battery device available and i have found that almost all the one i have test deliver only to of their rate capacity it is not that difficult to test the battery that you manufacture and give it a true rating instead of give an inflated rating and then talk about power loss etc just give the battery the proper rating of what the customer can expect from it that said new trent have produce a battery in the powerpak ultra that come close to deliver what it is rate to deliver than any other battery i have test except for aa battery such as the eneloop etc i have use three device to test the charge deliver galaxy note edition galaxy s t and an anker cell phone battery charger following is a table of three set of charge that i have compile the device were turn off during charge so the full charge can be measured not inclusive of running the device the second table show another feature of the new trent powerpak ultra that i greatly appreciate the led charge indicator lights actually represent pretty close the actual remain charge it can be seen from the table that although not exact the led indicator are close to true than any other battery i have test this is a big help to not have to guess the remain charge as you have to with other unit it is waste cost to include battery level indicator that are as hopeless inaccurate as other i have test here again new trent has add real value by making the basic function work properly instead of being poorly design delivery test table charge device charge deliver of rate capacity recharge time mah hour mah hour mah charge remain indicator test table led remain

User ID	A11T807LX2EF00	Reviews	great upgrade no complaint at all my old plantronic headset need to be replace and i went with this one it is much more sturdy with the headset rest very comfortable in the charge unit my old one would float once in a while and not charge when i thought it was which meant i couldnt use it the next day until it charged for a while not so with this uniti had a behind the head band i use which for me is very comfortable and i can quick take the headset off and it rest on my shoulder sound quality is excellent i have not had any complaint on the other end recommend this product for anyone need versatile and walking around from the base unit i can easily get file from across the room or do other things while talk without missing a beat	bulky but do the job i have own all the various iphone and battery life is always a problem when i saw this i a protective case and a charger all built into one that would make life the unit is solid built but it add a lot of bulk and weight to the iphone so much so that it defeat the sleek and glitzy design of the iphone so i will stay with one of my little battery charger that i can slip into my pocket and pull out when i need to add a bit of charge to the iphone and use this for those occasion when i dont mind have the extra bulk like in the car driving somewhere as the phone sit in a drink cup holder then again i could use my dc charger in those case but you get the do the job but it come at a weight and bulk	easy and very nice to use what a great idea the charge covercase is solid and do a great job protect the iphone and when you need a quick charge you just lay it on the charge pad and it do the rest no cable to mess with nothing to turn on just worksmy only issue is i wish you could plug in the iphone synccharge cable into this case so you can synch the phone you have to take the charger case off to get to the synch area that make it a bit all in all this is a wonderful and quick way to get that iphone charged it wont work for the iphone not until they come out with a charge covercase for it	great sound but slips this headset sound superb whether its music or a caller the sound is crisp and exceptional pair was easy and i pair my iphone and another cell phone the headset connect with both at the same time seamless and when i use one phone after i finish i can get a call on the other havent experienced get a call on the other while use the one yetmy only complaint is that the headset slips on my head almost lost it a few times when i tilt my head otherwise its comfortable enough i can still hear the outside world which is what i want when driving though i may be violate some traffic law have both ear block the control button works just fine and i have not had trouble with the volume slide not a problem at all for me i like the tone to confirm a changethe hinge seem solid enough i have not found them to be a problem once i figured out how they work to turn off you dont pull and bend you just bend to turn on you slide them in to each otherthe material lining the headset was comfortable enough though it got a little warm at timesbut not a big issueoverall this headset is great great sound easy to use now if i had a thick head of hair maybe that would solve my slip issue you cant go wrong with this headset	not right for me great sound though i have been try to find the right in the ear earpiece and thought perhaps jabra had done itthe sound quality is just great but i cant get these to work for me i have always had trouble with these type ear pieces the quality of construction is first rate but i cant get a comfortable judge these by my reaction you may like them and they might work just great for are jabra and are made well and sound just great				compact and good capacity to recharge your phone i have a bunch of these type charger some quite bulky and heavy other course the bulky one give you more capacity and can chargerecharge more than oncethi little unit is not bulky come with fold plug that you can plug into an ac outlet and recharge it no computer or usb power source need that a nice feature i often have to carry an ac adapter with me to recharge other such unit you can often find an ac outlet these days even airport have those charge when you charge up your device you can use a usb cable or if your device use a micro cable you can simply use the attach and unobtrusive micro cable that come with this unit very convenient i have an iphone with a lighting plug i also purchase from apple a adapter that adapter is very very small i have it on this cord and can use it on the iphoneipad if need or on a bluetooth headset by merely slip off the adapter now to carry this combination with you the cord will not sit into its selfcontaine slot on this unit so it is a little bulky with a cord a bit loose a small price to pay to have the option to charge with a lightning or micro plug save you the trouble of carry a usb cord as wellnow this isnt meant to be recharge a phone more than once but then again all you have to do is plug it in somewhere and charge it upthe led lights that give you the status all four on means its fully charged also tell you when you have it plug into an ac plug that it is fully charged when they go offvery convenient and functional unit had it with me the other day and it save the day for me	easy set up good sound comfortable blueant is a great company with great product this one fit the image nicelyit easy to set up this headset feel solid sit comfortable on you sound is good caller id announce which is nice considering if you are use a bluetooth headset you are likely to have your phone on a desk or in your pocket you dont want to answer all your call sometimes so its nice to know who is product and great features and the price is right too	great device and soooo sticky this a very compact and great device to hold a phone or even a gps in place on the dash i had no trouble attach it to the dashboard and it held it in place quite wellwhen i first attach a phone to it and then try to take it off i thought for sure i would have some damage to the back of the phone it took a bit of a pull to pry my phone away to my great surprise there was no damage or residue on the back of the phone i try this a number of times and each time the same experience the phone held in place quite nicely there are some little holder you can attach to help keep it in place but i found them not can also tilt this any which way you like so if you want portrait or landscape or something in between it is a simple tilt to is not too bulky of a unit i have had other similar one that were you can easily carry this with you and plop it on the dash or wherever you nice device	nice fit and great sound this unit wrap around the back of your head and over your ear sound complicated but it is fairly smooth and easy to use and put onit stays in place big issue for these type of headset and the sound is great havent had any complaint so you have both ear involved which make listen to music so much nice	bright color great length works well you can never have enough of these cable i keep them everywhere for when i need them and seem to never have one around when i need it go color i have is neon blue which stand out and is easily distinguished from other cable other may be use the length is great too usually these cable need a bit more length not this onethi is a great cable great length and bright color you cant go wrong	nice look bit wobbly connection first off this is a very nice look dock blend in with the other things i have on my desk nightstand very have to use the apple that came with the iphone it fit nicely into the slot hidden on the bottom the magnetic cover is very easy to take off and put onthe only gripe is that the connect do get loose at times because as you might suspect you have to pull a bit to loosen it from the iphone not usually a big deal but over time it needs to be pull to get it snug againthe audio plug works just fine and is not really something i use but its nice to it not for the very nice looks and classy design i would have knock a star off because of the issueoverall i would recommend and i purchase additional one to use at home and work	great compact design and a will charge two ipad at once i rent car a lot often some of the car only have one dc outlet most of the two in one charger are a bit bulky to lug around and if you do they cant always handle high output demand wellthi is quite compact in size and fit well in the dc outlet i have use it inand it put out a lot of power you can charge two ipad at once if you need to grant most dont need all that power but if you need to charge an ipad and something else you will appreciate have that cant go wrong with this excellent car charger	nice look design too many issue that plague this headset i thought this design really look great and came with a nice casecharger that kept it go for a number of charge until you could recharge the was the best part of my experience where to start well i had trouble keeping it in my ear try all the ear pieces it came with it glide over the ear and when a call came in i had to physically push it into my ear to hear the caller while i could hear fairly well if i held it in so so if i didnt my caller kept telling me i sound muffle and distant not a good thing in this day and like the slide volume control that usually work though at times it didnt seem to caller id was a nice feature but the voice answer never work for me i really was look forward to that working and saving me from physically do something to answer the phoneso nice design but not so nice sound quality and general operation	easy to use and great way to see your phone i have try a number of these type product most of them once put on the vent require pliers to get off this one has two size slot and once you pick the right one is easy to get on the vent but more important to remove from the do take a bit of maneuver to pull out the tab to get your phone or gps inside the bracket but once you do it hold it in place the mount also swivel so you can position your phone how you iphone show new message on the lock screen so i can quick glance at the phone when it lights up and see them for a bit without taking my hand off the wheel of course i need to make sure i have those few seconds to glance over and wont have any traffic issue but it certainly do give me a better cant go wrong with this product

User ID	AVBLGXSWRN666	Reviews	easy to use good audio quality no issue a couple of years ago i purchase a wellrate plantronic bluetooth headset while it perform well i was never able to get accustomed to the fact that it always felt like it was go to fall out of my ear there was no clip to go around the ear and i never was able to remember the steps necessary to turn it off hang it up etc one blinking light can only do so mucha a result i rarely use it that a shame as it wasnt cheap and im sure that given enough patience id probably get over the sensation that it was go to pop out of my ear and id finally remember how to operate it with this device became available i thought i would give a bluetooth headset another try i dislike holding a phone to my ear and the fact that this model had an ear clip gave me confidence that it would work out i didnt even realize the coolest feature until it arrive and i try it out for the first off the ear clip do what its supposed to do it keeps the headset in place and i never worry about drop it audio quality is very good and ive never received a complaint about my voice quality and ive never had a problem hearing the person on the other end of the call the flipout microphone arm make it very easy to turn on and off a single large but unobtrusive hidden in plain sight button on the headset allow you to end a call without fumble with the phonenow for the pleasant surprise and the coolest feature instead of a single blinking light that change colors to indicate status there is a voice that tell you through the headset what go on when it connect to the phone it say connected in a pleasant and clear voice when the call end that voice confirm that fact for youit ease of use and its performance earn the jabra supreme a rare star review from me its not the most device so youre not go to win any style points while wearing it however it do its job well and its easy to use while do it and those are the most important attribute in my book this device is highly recommend	seem like it should cost more good voice quality feel durable and triple minutes are a great combination this is a wellbuilt phone that is perfect for someone that doesnt need all the features of a smartphone but would like something better than a look at many of the choice for phone you can tell why they cost just its almost like they are built to be thrown away and the review seem to support their lack of quality has been very good text is easy use the slideout keyboard and the triple minutes keep the airtime pretty a few extra dollar you can get a good reliable and sturdy phone that feel good in your hand i highly recommend pick this phone up over the cheap model that are available	basic case that fulfill its mission but belie its price im a fan of the amazonbasic brand ive found quite a few of their product to be the equal or better of their counterpart usually at a percentage of the price when this case became available for review i thought it would be an excellent time to take it for a spin on a new iphone after spend a month with it and compare it to the belkin grip candy case cover for new apple iphone black ice i feel confident about being able to compare this case against a namebrand competitor as well as judge it on its own case has two pieces the cover that surround all but the face of the phone and a thin film that protect the screen as well the cover was very easy to install it fit the iphone perfectly and the side and top buttons were completely cover with raise area of the cover to indicate their location hole provide access to the mute switch lightning connect port and speakerthe plastic material is a flexible material that looks nice while providing a little more grip to a phone that i found to be a little on the slippery side after spend years with an iphone gs its shiny without being cheap look and it feel like it would provide some cushion in the event of a drop no iphone were drop in the course of prepare this review that combination of grip and slip work well for putt the phone in jeans pocket as well as coat i never felt like it was in the waythe power and volume buttons are a little difficult to activate however i had hope that this would improve with time but it did not im not the type to constant fiddle with tho buttons so it wasnt a big deal but its something to consider if you use those buttons to the belkin cover the amazonbasic cover isnt as nice the belkin looks nice although i would have prefer an allblack unit to the belkin scheme the smoke color of this cover works well with the black until now i have not mention the screen cover and that is because it is the weakest aspect of this cover ive never had a screen protector before so i cant compare it to other but i found the cover difficult to apply without bubble that i couldnt remove with the included card and small dust particle kept get in between the screen and the sheet when i was install it i was also disappointed with the alignment of the hole in the protector as they were offcenter by about i try to lift the sheet after install it so that i could remove some dust and then that corner never applied itself as well again this might all be user error but i just remove it and threw it away kudos to amazon for including a protector sheet as the higherprice belkin cover did notfor the price i think the amazonbasic cover did its job however i think this is one of those situation where you do get what you pay for and those look for more will need to pay more than the economical price that this cover is current being sold at cover are go to be a personal preference thing so if the photo of this cover appeal to you i can recommend it as well worth try at most youll have spent and if you dont care for it you can pass it along to a friend or keep it around as a spare	snug fit for phone touchscreen use but could be improve ive never use an armband before so i cant render a judgement on how this item compare to other like it i use this armband while walking my dog to see how it perform in that first impression was that the armband was quite large and bulky but after thinking about it i dont see any way that they could reduce its size so its probably the size that it needs to be slide an iphone into place is quite snug and i found it easy to remove the case i was use than to wrestle with the plastic took some time to adjust the clip just right but after it is adjust the clip make it easy to use and remove the armband i did find that it tend to slip even when walking so i can understand the issue report by other while running i think this has to be a matter of finding a balance between have it loose enough so it doesnt feel like a blood pressure band while still holding its the phone touchscreen was pretty easy even if the home button was partially obscure by the top portion of the band surround this might just be a matter of shove the phone further into the sleeve but given the tight of that sleeve i think people will run into that issue more often than was ok for what it was i dont think you can get away from feeling at least a little like you have a blood pressure band on but that may go away with timeone aspect that i thought could be improve was in the flap that cover the phone after it is insert the flap completely cover the phone which is probably good from a rain protection standpoint it make the flap stand up completely if you are use earbud without a rightangle connect such as the one included with the iphone i would like to see either a hole for the headphone jack or that part of the flap remove so the entire flap doesnt have to make room for an earbud reading the other review it seem that there are some other armband that people like and they are a little cheap than this one while i dont dislike this armband i dont see anything spectacular about it either for my walking purpose ill probably go back to putt the phone in my pocket instead of wearing this armband especially in the hot summer weather	the best case ive try even if its not metal let get one thing out of the way right away even though this product title use the word metal twice in its name nothing in it is actually made from metal its all could be a problem if the quality of the plastic was substandard in feel or fit fortunately this is an attractive case that fit the iphone very well several pieces make up the final assembly the surround is two pieces which make installation a snap a clear back plate which fit very well and even a screen protector which i did not use some home button sticker were included but feel free to give them to your year old to play withthe phone fit very nicely without sloppy or any other fit problem edge are suitable smooth with no sharp area to cause problem with handle the hole that provide access to the lightning and headphone port are suitable large to fit the supply applebrande accessory that came with the phone i try three different headphone to make sure that their connect will fit and didnt have any a rightangle connect on my car cassette adapter was not happy with the size of the headphone port hole a little modification of the connect should clear that up but until then the bottom portion of the surround can be remove pretty easily speak of the bottom surround portion there is an extra bottom surround piece that is i try it out and the contrast look is not to my liking but its there to try to see if you like itive been use this case for several week and i have to say i am quite happy with it access to the control works very well it slide in and out of a jeans pocket easily and feel pretty good in the hand even though it is not made from metal it is attractive in its own the price of this item is on the high side in my opinion this is a wellbuilt and attractive case that do its job nicely
