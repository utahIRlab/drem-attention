","1) the best tom sawyer i ever saw this movie was play at radio city music hall back in the days of the show it was also present in mm on that huge radio city screen i remember how impress i was with that opening scene with the steam boat go down the river and you see tom running thru the field and the music build more and more wowwhat a great movie seen many version of but this one seem to be the best ever brought to the screen maybe because its a musical whatever made this so successful back then you will not be disappointed by its and scope a must for ever america kid and adult too this is as red white and blue as it get and now must be the most politics incorrect movie ever made hehe buy it before some group put a ban on it which should want you to buy this for the kid even more they dont make them like this anymore
2) presentation is the best everything has already been said about the technical standing of this wonderful unit my review is about presentation this is often over look with people like me that has a screen and seating for and running when possible i have two of these unit the best feature is you can cue up a preview on one unit and cue up your feature on the second unit it take about seconds to change over from one unit to the other and if you time your trailer preview correct you can close your curtain and reopen it after the trade mark of your feature you can not do this with any other make of bluray player working in picture theatre all my life presentation is everything its a lost art in today modern theatre",Tom Sawyer [VHS],https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/21J51BBX9WL._AC_.jpg,[]

","1) wholesome and entertaining bit of this is a wellmade and musical version of the tom sawyer story it do not follow the book exactly but the substance is there charming performance by then child actor johnny tom and foster becky thatch and celeste holm as aunt polly i thorough enjoy this movie i rent it for my granddaughter school project and wound up watch it times it took me back to my childhood of play with the children next door in a more worldhigh recommend
2) excellent ive use this spray for years i always works well i like it for pencil sketch you can even use it for watercolor i have spray a few of my keepsake painting from famous teacher of mine not something to do without being confident of your spray spray watercolor can be frame without glass something to consider with large painting since glass can be really heavy and acrylic can be expensive stephen quill share a while back that he spray his large painting now as an alternative to covering them with glass since its difficult and expensive to ship heavy large painting cover with quill ship a lot of his painting considerable distance see his books and dvd here on amazon for example color choice painter guide to colors etchigh recommend
3) great sound comfortable fit the sound is loud when you wish and clear also pleasant mellow several member of my family have try them including me and we all like themthe cost seem reasonable especially for the good soundan especially good feature is the included earsleeve of different size this is important since if they are too small or too large they just wont stay in and you can choose a size you find most comfortable also its true the cord is not easily recommend for anyone look for this type of audio device",Tom Sawyer [VHS],https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/21J51BBX9WL._AC_.jpg,[]

","1) no microphone volume this is a solid well built unit that i have no problem use or hearing the only problem i have is that there is no volume control for the microphone which seem to be an exception for most plantronic headset ive seen i have to really speak up to get caller to hear me even after adjust the microphone boom to the position that give the highest volume
2) better than power strip hand down i bought two and threw a power squid and power strip away for computer gear you want this one because it do not include an off switch which can unexpected shut down your computer the flexible cords allow me to better organize equipment under my desk great product
3) prone to damage this work fine for a while but then the clip on one of ethernet jack broke off which make it useless because it wont stay plug in this is a great idea but the manufacturer should have add boots to protect the plastic clip you only find boots on higher quality ethernet cable and for permanent connected cable left in place theyre superfluous in this case because the cable get a lot of abuse while travel a boot is nearly require for longevity additional the housing is quite a bit big than i was expect im not a fan of belkin but im go to try their version which is obviously small and less than half the price on amazon it was fine for the few week it last but not worth the price for the amount of use i got out of it
4) great keyboard update after monthsthe enter key has become mushy and require a lot of pressure to register a key press will be send this in for a warranty replacement this is really disappointing and doesnt bode well for longevity my prior keyboard was years old and still go strong in fact ill likely have to switch back to that while wait for a replacement between this keyboard issue and quality control issue with mice google logitech double click i dont think ill be buy any more logitech product they perform well for a short time but theyve consistent been break down the mouse i had before the quirky logitech version was years old btwso im not hard on reviewthi is a super sexy look keyboard that feel great i thought it had chiclet key look at the picturethat actually what i want however its a shallow keyboard with good key travel feel so im happy early reviewer mention an issue with key block but i am not seeing it i type to wpm so if this was an issue in early model its been fixed since i would buy this again in a heartbeat
5) works but with it had a lanyard this works but wish it had a lanyard like the amzer mini to micro converter this is too easy to get lost in a bag and it would be better if there were a way to attach it to the end of a cable",Plantronics T20 Corded 2-Line Convertible Headset Telephone,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41v-YHAsYqL._AC_.jpg,"['Adjustable noise-canceling headset with microphone', '3-way conference calling', 'Online and mute indicators', 'Flash, redial, and hold features', 'Connects to existing telephone jacks']"

","1) plantronic t perfect deadly plantronic t perfect would be the perfect headset phone if not for a few deadly misstep that led me to return build solid the right size the right features buttons for mute hold red conference and flash plus volume and tone control and the mute has a red indicator so you dont forget although id prefer an indicator that flash like on the polycom conference phonesalso high quality sound in the headset i could hear the other party perfectly with only a faint background start with the most seriousthe people i talk with said that i sound distant it appear that the microphone doesnt come forward far enough to pick up my voice wellthe headset cord is not shield and pick up noise from the computer in particular i had to be careful to route the cord so that it avoid the keyboard or it picked up a loud tone both party heardthe headset cord is very thin and i worried that a minor mistake such as catching it in a close a desk drawer would seriously damage itthere is no headset for the t that cover both ear binaural i call to verify this although the headset jack in the base is physically compatible with the binaural headset from my m the headset from the m do not work with the tit seem like they could make this the perfect phone just by making a few straightforward engineering change but until there was always a low hiss in the headset in look into noisecancele technology i learned that these system typically introduce a hiss of their own in a noisy environment you dont notice the hiss because the noise the circuitry take out is much greater than the hiss it add but in a quiet environment like mine there is no benefit to the noisecancele feature and you hear the hiss i cant guarantee that this was the source of the hiss i heard but it seem likely there is no way to disable the noisecancele circuitry i dont think the amazon list mention the noisecancele feature of this phone but its on the box
2) very well made im skeptical about the audio improvement some claim for these stabilizer or clamp in generalbut then truth be told i bought this for the visual impact something to make the turntable a little more interesting and for that this is just fine they claim its made by cnc computer numerical control and i can believe that easily the manufacture is flawlessand its not to high to stop the turntable lucite cover from close but that vary with the turntable so you should measure your headroom before order
3) nice player excellent value looks good works perfectly no complaint if you need a basic cd player you would be very happy with this one
4) no problem i just plug it into a usb jack and it works perfectly note that it is very small and would be easy to misplace
5) nice very nice although my threeyearold sony vaio only support usb i didnt want a hub that would become obsolete with my next computer and i didnt want an unpowered hub that wouldnt host device such as my external usb hard drive this fill the bill i am not support usb the usb hard drive are usb device and they work perfectly with this hub and my usb computera nice feature is that there is a blue led for each usb port and the led turn on when the device is logically connected to the computer so if you plug in a device and the light doesnt come on you know the computer is not recognize the devicenote that this hub is large than your typical usb hub that not a complaint only an observationthe hub is quite lite personally i wish it were heavy and had nonskid feet to keep if from moving around on the desk but this is a recommendedupdate after is still working highly recommend",Plantronics T20 Corded 2-Line Convertible Headset Telephone,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41v-YHAsYqL._AC_.jpg,"['Adjustable noise-canceling headset with microphone', '3-way conference calling', 'Online and mute indicators', 'Flash, redial, and hold features', 'Connects to existing telephone jacks']"

","1) good for listen not for talk ive use plantronic headset for years i was surprise that there was no volume adjust for the mic every other plantronic headset ive use had one i must have had a dozen people tell me they could hardly hear me in days of use no amount of adjust the headset position on my head solve the problem i had to pull the mic nearly into my mouth for people to hear me other than that it was perfect im return it
2) i like it a lot ive been use this keyboard for a few month now and really find it comfortable and well built i havent really use any of the custom option but may once i get a bit more time in the latter part of the year the only drawback ive notice is that the key action sometimes seem to have a bit of resistance i only notice it when i use a single key repetition eg j for the next item in google reader there seem to be just a slight bit of sticky probably because i am push the key instead of tap it as in normal type wasnt sure id like the palm rest but i definitely do very comfortable",Plantronics T20 Corded 2-Line Convertible Headset Telephone,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41v-YHAsYqL._AC_.jpg,"['Adjustable noise-canceling headset with microphone', '3-way conference calling', 'Online and mute indicators', 'Flash, redial, and hold features', 'Connects to existing telephone jacks']"

4) love the gb hd anyone run gb on usb power review for gb and gb drive are combine here so its not clear about gb drive power i have the gb and it runs from usb power love it but need more technical detail for the gb drive state power via external acpower supply included and some reviewer report that the external supply is necessary other report otherwise about their simpletech drivecan the gb drive operate from the usb port without the external ac not all usb port are create equal in terms of how much power they can deliver i have the gb and it would not run on one usb laptop port but would run on an adjacent port iow one port could not supply enough current whereas the other could ditto for various usb port on my desktop some work some did not i belabor this point because there was no indication from the st drive that it was insufficient power the led lit ok but the drive simply click away in futile desperation while try to spin upso i am guess that the reviewer who couldnt get the gb to work on their pclaptop did not connect to a highpowere port can anyone confirm that the gb drive runs on usb power alone thanx
5) too slow if you have usb dont bother with this antique drive it runs at a max of about mbytessec slow down to about or mbs after mb or so this means it can take over hour to fill itinstead get asandisk extreme gb usb flash drive up to mbs this fantastic usb drive is advert to run mbs i certainly beat that as measured by hd tune read test at mbs writing i got around mbs when copy from an ssdnote you wont get this speed if youre copy from a laptop hd as youre lucky to get much more than mbs from a rpm drive but that still better than times fast than a usb drive such as this oneif you do have an ssd drive and usb port you can get better than mbs with the sandisk extreme that more than times fast",Punch!

","1) a great microphone this is a good product with decent audio quality and plenty of fidelity for the karaoke revolution games and bonus it works on the pc too
2) its a cable its a cable and its fast and cheap not a lot to say about it really if i need more id buy this again
3) love it im a big fan of these trackpad they work great they have cool multitouch function the battery last a long time and they match the other apple product if you care about that sort of thing
4) how to make it work for video this card is more than sufficient for hd video i shoot on a canon ti and while i occasional see the buffer bar on the side of the screen my camera never stop recording the card is reliable and plenty fast but i did have the same problem a lot of the other reviewer are havingthe buffer bar on my camera would come up almost immediately and the video would stop recording i did a ton of research on the topic because this was my second card from a second brand and i was still have the issue here what i found when there are section of an sd sdhc or sdxc memory card that are not properly format the camera cant tell that it should be skip those section the memory card data transfer controller is built into the camera and as a result is unaware of bad chunk of space as it try to write to those section it fail and the buffer doesnt clear itself of that data it doesnt take long then for the buffer to fill and cause recording to stop compact flash cards are different the data transfer controller is apparently built into the card so data is direct to good section of the card basically there could be a problem with the data on a cf card and youd never know about itthe solution is simple lowlevel format a normal format tell the camera to ignore data from the card and write over file as it needs the space but it doesnt actually erase and rebuild the cards file structure a lowlevel format actually clear the space and write s all over the card which eliminate problem area in the data i shoot a ti so ill describe where it is on that camera i assume its the same spot as for the ti but i dont know for sure go to your camera menu use the menu button go to the first yellow setting section of the menu and select format in the format menu hit the trash can button to select lowlevel format choose ok and let the format work it only take a couple of seconds when its done try recording video again voila this should take care of your video youre have buffer problem i feel bad for you son just do a lowlevel format and your recording will runnote this review is copy onto one other memory cards review section i bought another brand and return it for the same problem and my assumption is that the problem would have been fixed with the same process just a bit of transparency so nobody think im just spam the review

","1) get it if you are go to play karaoke revolution or any playstation game then you need this mike the headset bundle with the game is neither durable nor practical and as mention before it rarely fit everyone and it broke a few week after i bought the game this logitech mic is much better and you can be a true karaoke star without worry about get too far for the cord its feet or knock the headset off your head with your crazy move id say the only downside is that in volume when you do sing and dance you can get entangle in the cord if youre not careful but i just bought one for our kr game and im about to get another so we can do duet d
2) adequate for computer sound not for music i bought these speaker as more or less a starter pair for when i dock my notebook computer at my desk ive got a monitor large keyboard and hence speaker to make it sort of a desktop notebook so to speak i wasnt expect like a bose level quality or anythingbut these speaker are really only decent for play the random sound a computer make beep buzz whatever also like maybe skype even though it sound a little grainy my fiance bass voice sound tinny and highpitched when we converse over skype when he deploy but music definitely not i admit that im kind of a snob about my music sound i want some bass and these speaker do not have any bass to speak of my ipod headphone sound better if you really cant afford anything else and youre just go to be listen to computer sound then i guess these are fine but if you like to listen to music at your desk i suggest something better
3) i love this mouse i read the review here and on the apple website before i bought this mouse and they were so mixed ultimately i decided to purchase it anyway and im glad i did this has easily been the best mouse ive ever use im use mac os x mountain lion i bought the mouse in midseptember so ive been use it for about a month i also want to state that since i read the review and knew about some of the problem i immediately downloade magicpref before i even start use the mousefirst of all form factor i dont really care how my mouse looks i want it to work however i do care about portable and this mouse is super portable i had a little vera bradley zip id case the clip zip id that i wasnt use and i can slip the mouse in there easily and throw it in my bag with bluetooth there are no dongle to keep track of in the computer or outside and i have found that the drain on my macbook pro isnt as bad as i thought it would be keeping the bluetooth on all day i still get about or hour out of my macbook pro i can probably stretch it to hour without the bluetooth on all daya for comfort holding this mouse do take some get use to if you are use to rest your palm against a mouse but once i got use to it i have found that this mouse is not terribly uncomfortable and actually improve the position of my wrist greatly as other have said i rest my thumb against one side and my ring and pinky finger along the other and generally speak i rest my index finger on the mouse and allow my middle finger to hover over it until its need magicpref allow you to enable three and fourfinger click and swipe and i find it quite easy if not exactly natural to lift my other finger and place them on the mouse if need i will say that i get fatigue with this mouse fast than with other my finger go stiff fast however that after hour a day of usage im a doctoral candidate writing my dissertation so im here a lot but i can generally use for to hour continuous before i feel cramp and after that its time for a break anywayi have had zero bluetooth connective problem once i turn the mouse on and my computer find it it stays connected until i turn the mouse off ive use it on other computer too my work imac has a mighty mouse which i hate and still no bt connective problem perhaps the people who have problem in that area have faulty mice but i havent experienced that this mouse has very smooth track it come on one of the lowest speed setting by default so you can always turn up the speed but personally the midlevel speed is fine for me i recently had to switch back to a regular optical mouse for a night when my battery die and i found the regular mouse to be jumpy and imprecise compare to the magic mouse i was itch to get back to itthe most magical thing about this mouse is the scroll if you have a nonclick scroll wheel like on many microsoft mice you are experience something relatively close but not quite the momentum scroll is just great it allow precise control of scroll down a page i can flick and send my page spin i can scroll to an exact place its very smooth and honestly this by itself make the mouse worth it to mein the past i have found that apple mice have very unsatisfye click since the entire thing depress but that not the case with this mouse it give a satisfying click i have my regular preference set to secondary click so i can use right click i have had very few problem with the mouse recognize the difference between a right click and a left click and its usually because ive use my right finger a little too far to the lefti think that for most people the regular preference out of the box are sufficient with the regular preference you can enable secondary click for a right click and use the regular scroll with one finger if you double tap with your left finger you can use smart zoom which will either zoom in farther or zoom out i have found that to be jumpy and not all that smart so i dont use it much swipe left or right with one finger allow you to swipe through page within app or for example i can swipe my firefox tab across the top of my window if i have too many tab open to see in one window and swipe left or right with two finger allow you to swipe between app doubletapp with two finger bring up mission control this works much more reliable than the smart zoom doubletap for some reason this alone is more than a traditional mouse would give you so i think its a bit absurd to say that the magic mouse is basically unusable out of the do add many more option for example i have current set a twofinger click to be the same as command left click which make select multiple option within a list easy three finger click bring up launchpad and fourfinger click bring up mission control but you can set these yourself as well as pinch and swipe movements although the program do warn you that some are hard to execute than they sound for example i have two finger updown swipe as zoom inout but they dont work very often there are also other program like bettertouchtool that allow you to change the preference and make your magic mouse do even moreso basically i think any os x user who wants smooth track and a variety of option in their mouse would do well to take a look at this one
4) love these headphone i was in best buy buy a new ipod classic my music collection has outgrown the nano when i spotted these headphone on a listen station i was immediately attract to the look most awesome headphone are kinda ugly and not very stylish so i pop them on and gave a listeni didnt want to take them off the sound is very rich mid and high especially i bought a pair and i am hearing things in my music that i could never hear before in my less expensive headphone the headphone sound great even at a low volume which is nice another huge plus for me is onear headphone begin to irritate me after a short time but these aroundtheear can are much more comfortablemy only complaint is that the bass is a little bit lacking in them i listen to a lot of hiphop and rb and i dont really hear the thump in the bass that i like its not that it has no bass or even bad bass its just not the heavy thumping bass i tend to likei also wish i had went with the browngold design that was the model that was on display but i end up buy a red pair still stylish but it doesnt have the beautiful retro design of the browngold im not sure why i didnt get the browngold because i like them so much when i saw them huh",Playstation 2 USB Microphone,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/312YFWGB5AL._SY445_.jpg,"['USB microphone for use with PlayStation2 karaoke games', 'Durable construction ensures long-lasting use', 'Designed to accurately reproduce singing voice', 'Includes lengthy 15-foot cable', ""Compatible with Konami's Karaoke Revolution""]"

","1) sweet first off to really enjoy the game you need a big surrond sound system and a big monitor but hey what game dont you have to have thoe things but anyway this game is awsome pretty much the game say you have to do x things each mission and then set you free you decide which weapon to equip your ship with and more importan where to equip them this game is play in dimention so weapon mount on the bottom of your ship cant fire at target above unless the ship rolls over or flip around it do it automatic it also has some funny dialogue like commander sweetwater calling your ai a cyber pet and analretentive the graphics are spectacular they really took advantage of the space setting to give wonderful detailed object and are some con tho namely there is no ending you complete your final objective you see a little cutscene that end with your ai saying that she go to kill gods and it end you never know what happen to most of your friends or they all end up this really cane be call a con but for a while your under the command of who put you down every chance he get even after you save his and he do other things that make life much hard for you for a while but that just add an interesting be intimidate by the command and everything once you get use to them its aight and once you get over the lack of sleep from stay up all night and play this its aight too
2) great keyboard for the price i was look for a new illuminate keyboard to replace my virtually indestructible keyboard whose letters had worn off i saw this keyboard for and was a bit skeptical but it had many star review so i bought it i can say that i am very happy with it with the illumination off they key are easy to see but with it on if you look straight down at it and move your eyes back and forth you can get a bit disoriente i believe this could have been solve by choose a different illumination color such as a forest green or a deep blue this is a laptopstyle keyboard and it is small so it will take some get use to for most everyone yes the illumination do turn off if you dont press a key for several seconds or so but come back on when you press any key its feet are well rubberize so once you put it on a nice grip surface it wont budge that easily the only other thing that i do not like about this keyboard is the inclusion of the quick access key and volume knob neither of which are illuminate overall for this keyboard cant be beat
3) great stand for the price but missing a couple of features i got this monitor stand to replace the abysmal stand that came with my samsung bw inch monitor its amazing the amount of difference it is between look level or down on a monitor to up at it much easy on your neck as you can actually rest against the back of the chair the outer shell is plastic matte black and feel fairly rugged as in it wont crack and the inside stand is all metal the thing weigh lbs and surprising very stable once the monitor is on there if you have a x vesa type mount on your monitor m include thumbscrew you can use instead of the regular screw which is very handy small monitor with x mount or either with a recess mount must use the conventional screwsthere are however a few con first off is that it is not a tilt it is which isnt a lot of negative tilt be much better if it was there is also no click to hold the monitor at a perfect horizontal or perfect vertical which is a bit annoy the hole to route the cable through is just a touch to small my dvi cable rf shield couldnt fit through i could take a file and enlarge the hole but i shouldnt have to also it is made in china so your money doesnt stay over here shame on you mall in all its a great stand its the kind that should come standard on every monitor just has a couple of slight flaw which costs it a star",Nexus: The Jupiter Incident - PC,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51BEZH1VWFL.jpg,"['Epic campaign with 6 Episodes and more than 26 thrilling missions', ""Powered by Mithis' unique Black Sun 3D engine"", 'Spectacular real-time battles with breathtaking motion picture quality', 'Diverse mission types - espionage, fight, stealth, sabotage, rescue, science, etc.', 'NPCs and crew with improving skills']"

",1) easy to use but hard to set up the bluray disc remote is great once its set up but setup is no simple task first of all instruction are confuse there are two buttons which need to be pressed together start and enter trick is that the enter button as explain in the manual for the remote is the x button there is another enter button in the middle of the dpad which is actually label enter and is the correct one you have to use that enter the second challenge is that this remote may fail to pair if the regular wireless sixaxi remote is also in use esp by wireless at the same time apparently there can be enough interference to cause issue turning the regular remote off and then do the push did the trick pair its awfully nice to have a regular remote for view disk,Sony PlayStation 3 Blu-ray Disc Remote,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71aGPQRTNNL._SY606_.jpg,['The remote control uses Bluetooth wireless communication to operate playback of Blu-ray Discs (BD) and other types of disc media on the Playstation 3 system.']

","1) durable comfortable own my saitek for well over two years now and i have not encounter one sign of age for key it still feel very responsive and tactile for those not wanting to spring for a more expensive and noisy mechanical keyboard i have relatively big hand and even after extend periods of game i rarely get cramps or feel backlight still as bright as when i first got it color choice are nice dim works and knob doesnt feel cheap comfortable tactile key well space hand rest extension picture below the space bar obviously is much better for comfort and can be extend for big hand like mine stand also help media buttons work perfectly with wmp and media player classic havent try anything else led indicator for num lock cap lock and that down arrow we the heck that iscon led backlight could be sharper too dim for my taste same go for the key themselves there not much passthrough for lighting media buttons feel cheap compare to the key and light dim knob no game mode to temporary disable window key while in game stand feel cheap hand is made of cheap plastic would have prefer a more userfriend material a tad expensive for the competition but i have not actually felt the other not nearly as comfortable as mechanical key although that a pretty moot con as it is what it isother thought i bought this for around the same price over years ago so im shock at how much it is still for only or more you can get a logitech g series the gap between the key are perfectly length albeit a bit big therefor occasional care is a must just make sure to blow compress under different place and youll be fine not that big of a concern but something to keep in mind
2) use ps for media this is a must have if youre like me and use ps not only for game but for video and blueray this is a must have at first i thought oh i can just use my ps controller but when i got it on impulse i was extremely satisfiedpro many buttons including the customizable red green blue and yellow buttons bluetooth is a treat and setting it up is so easy through the ps menu register bd controller you can also turn on the ps with it and use it to scroll through the menu as it also has the standard buttons that on the controller this means you never have to touch your if you only need to use ops for videocon no backlight which i think should be a must have for all controller and remote you cant use it to control games which is sad i love play the psn online poker game and it would be nice to use the remote seeing as how you only use buttons
3) its cheap it works flimsy compare to mose cheap hdmi cablesit works as do all cable for cheap never buy cable at a retail store you will always find it cheap i can think of
4) good case cheap company its a great case that fit everything perfectly with a cool little window and vent placement for my problem with them they only include one rear case fan my philosophy is if you push so hard on the point of great airflow include a goddamn intake fan less than to make matter worse none of the many screw included are for a fan in the front which is extremely important as my case is red hot without itthe difference is night and day and the screw i do have to get are cm because the damn case doesnt even have a bracket for me to put my fan in so now im gonna lug on over to home depot only to hope and pray it worksalso there a space for a case fan on top but an average thickness fan wont fit between the top and the ram so i had to hunt down a thin fanand more screwit all just a bunch of extra work that could have been solve by less lazy and cheap from this company although they use good material they obviously could give a rats ass about the customer never order a product off these guy again
5) great product faulty connection i dont understand how a product who main function is to connect wireless to the internet can have so many connection issue according to the many review that reflect my issue this is not uncommon and i dont believe its something an rma can fix this is a firmware issue pure and sound quality and app integrate along with the overall solid build its like a basketball player who can run jump block pass shoot and dribble but is unable to hold a basketball",Sony PlayStation 3 Blu-ray Disc Remote,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71aGPQRTNNL._SY606_.jpg,['The remote control uses Bluetooth wireless communication to operate playback of Blu-ray Discs (BD) and other types of disc media on the Playstation 3 system.']

","1) should be bundle with the ps this specialized bluetooth remote for the ps is very nice and include all of the function one needs to use the ps more as a connected multifunction bluray player device and less as a game machinei it essential no actually with a normal ps controller you can do everything this remote do although in in far more steps and often with no clue what button means pause and which means menu so in that this remote is a huge helpit should also be noted if you have a new model hdmienable television there a good chance you can set it and the ps to allow your tv remote to control many of its basic function including navigation and playpausestop we have a sony bravia and its remote did workbut it couldnt turn on the ps and it didnt seem to be able to pull up a bluray disc menuhowever i do find it odd that this remote given its available for under isnt simply included with the ps at this price obviously it doesnt cost very much to manufacture and it make a huge difference in the use of one of sony flagship product it works well and is easily pairedconnecte with the ps on the other hand im tired of add still more remote to the pile and suspect that my spouse has notice my verbal complaint and may be get me a logitech harmony one universal remote with the ps adapter for christmas absent that though i consider this remote to be an essential accessory for the playstation on update just yesterday i was given an early christmas gift a logitech harmony one remote with the ps adapter accessory definitely a more pricey solution and while i dont mind have this remote here as a backup clearly its go into the drawer turn out the ps can only support one bluetooth remote accessory at a time anyway
2) finally a truly universal remote i already love this remote despite the often not that hard to get a remote where you can enter a code number and itll control a number of device some can learn from existing remote we had a oneforall kameleon for some years but it was kludgey couldnt really be custom i was never able to get downloade remote program to work on it and it ate battery like the remote on our coffee table proliferate like a warren of rabbit one for the tv another for the av receiver still other for the cable box roku cinematube media player playstation yamaha regionfree dvd change too many remotesi received the harmony one and its ps adapter accessory as an early holiday gift actually my spouse told me to go buy it now its still early for a real review but my first impression are very positive with a few small initial program can be intimidate to the nontechnic but if you follow the program wizard you should be able to get the remote up and running with reasonably complete functional within a couple hour the inbox print documentation while slick is in my opinion extremely inadequate there are some important detail information and instruction which just cant really be figured out from the multilingual pictogram and declare sentence ill cover a few of these below in helpful hint the charge display is total mislead and a bad design mistake also cover below made worse by mislead documentation should be more flexible in create activity other than just the single generic utility choice should be given option for custom activity icon too wish there were more custom icon option for the touchscreen buttons at present you can only do tv channel i also wish there was some way to mix activity and device sometimes you just want to control the one device and it take a few steps to make this happen also as people have noted device are sort alphabetical be nice to be able to sort them as one likes not inexpensive especially if you add the ps adapter not a remote you want young children or clumsy drunken adult to be fool withpro sleek welldesigne physically comfortable to hold in the hand buttons are wellplace and easy to reach and all of them are of a good size havent had a remote this comfortable since we retired our old tivo backlight and touchscreen lighting are very nice the touchscreen itself seem responsive but not overly so sensitivity is also configurable i like the tilt sensor for turning it on when you pick up the remote unlike our old kameleon which flares like a blue nova if you even breathe at it between logitech fairly comprehensive online database plus a few missing buttons i had harmony learn this is the first remote ive own which has been able to learn every single remote we current have i very much like the custom possibility in setting or reprogramm buttons to do whatever you want and its wonderful being able to program every single button on the remote for multiple function i havent even begun to explore multifunction sequence however i wish there was a more advanced interface available and not force nearly everything to go through the wizard no problem have the harmony learn new command from our other remote i need to add some buttons from the sony bravia remote most notably the number pad period and enter hint the battery go in with the blank white side up they really should print this side up and an insertion arrow on it push it in until the back edge drops into place there a little spring in the back of the battery enclosure providing resistance for the last quarter inch to remove the battery lift the edge slightly and the spring should pop it out when you put the harmony one in the cradle if its charge the touchscreen show what looks like a fill battery with a lightning bolt through it the only thing this indicate is that the harmony is in fact receiving power otherwise ignore this static icon display as it in no way show actual battery charge amount if you pick up the remote on the touchscreen in the upper right corner above the datetime there a tiny cellphone style battery bar pretty small but that where you can find the actual battery level normal charge time to full from outofthebox seem to be about hour supposedly there enough charge straight off to do the basic program setupbut i decided to wait a while just in case for learning from other remote the harmony needs to be connected to your computer and the logitech program running follow the prompt to add a button there online help if youre not sure how to do this note that the receiver for learning new code is at the bottom of the harmony not the top as is usual for other learning remote also the guide wizard say it may take up to seconds to learn the function but this doesnt mean mash the button and hold it press and release the button to learn from as you normally would use it if the program doesnt pick it up wait a couple seconds and press it again the program itself usually will tell you if its get a good signal or not once learned you can assign the new function to any button on the remotewould i get this remote again yes one remote to rule them all as ive heard many times would i recommend it to a friend also yeswould i recommend it for the technological challenge sort of this might work out best if you or someone you know who is techsavvy did the setup and program for them however for example my spouse has been so intimidate by all our remote and the complicated steps necessary to do almost anything with our setup here essentially i always run the equipment when we watch anything i do think shed be a little put off by the program of the harmony since it can get complicated fast she nevertheless likes the harmony because now she can just point and shoot watch tv boom done watch media player done play a movie ditto

",1) this remote hardly compliments the advanced engineering that went into the ps but at least the price is reasonable i like keeping things simple where remote are concerned i normally opt for an endtable full of specialized manufacturer remote over one more complicated universal remote where unless i know how to program a computer it still wont give me all the function of the original remote or will require flipping through multiple file and folder to find the device im wanting to operate of course since the ps use bluetooth even the more remote are less practical to the task this make it all the more disappointing that after several years sony still hasnt release a better alternative for control their most herald piece of technologyi can appreciate sony design sense in that this remote has the same basic shape as all of our other sony remote otherwise there really doesnt appear to be much thought or effort that went into the design after several ps update including a major makeover in the design what amount to just slap all the possible buttons one might ever use into a cheap plastic slab and writing playstation on it is still the only viable alternative for those that dont find the game controller optimum or adequate for bd movie playback do sony not even get that there a sizable market of people look for something better look at all the aftermarket device claim to be made just for the ps but get very mixed review as to their quality reliability and try to use this remote in the dark or very dim environment most typical of ht youll need plenty of light to see what youre pressing not to mention your reading glasses even then the buttons are so small tight cluster and uniform colored size and shaped you may lose a minute of the movie try to find the right one even with the light on thank heaven the ps is so fast at load and process command if i accidental hit stop instead of pause while fumble in the dark to answer the phone on my panasonic bd player remote not only would i lose my spot in the film it would take another minutes for the disc to from the remote being rather ugly and unfriend as its just too small for all the dot it try to connect we dont like how pressing any botton automatic turn on the ps with an end table full of remote and kid visiting now and then its just too easy to activate and with blue tooth we practically have to carry it to the other end of the house just to lightly dust the remote without issue who know what type of command to the ps with the tv off point the remote away from the screen is nolonger an optionthe ps is a magnificent piece of engineering that prove that sony can do much better this remote neither lives up to expectations for sony premium piece of electronics nor do it compliment its engineering innovation or style just add a backlight and hiding half the key most will rarely if ever use under a slide door like some of their other remote would go along way toward making this remote more userfriend and functional if only they would try,Sony PlayStation 3 Blu-ray Disc Remote,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71aGPQRTNNL._SY606_.jpg,['The remote control uses Bluetooth wireless communication to operate playback of Blu-ray Discs (BD) and other types of disc media on the Playstation 3 system.']

","1) do what it is supposed to not sure what to say it works as intended but had i known that my samsung tv remote would do the exact same thing i would have save myself the money tv remote or not if i had to do it over again i probably would not buy this ps remote just do not get use often and when it do get use i am constant ask by family to interpret the buttons etc easy to just use the game remote or the tv remote imo
2) best for the price after look on dell site and on amazon i chose this battery for the low cost and expect life while the battery do not last nearly as long as claim with my laptop on full bright and wifi i still get about hrs per charge add to that the fact that the charge only take about min to go from nothing to top and go to trickle after so as not to burn the thing downbattery for dell are garbage regardless of the it is just a fact that they did not design these with battery life as any sort of concern that being said i will happily buy another one when this one die life for money cannot be beat i am on month i believe with no issue at alledit have had the battery for well over a year and have gone through every power cycle possible still works just as well as any dell battery and costs soooo much less great product upgrade to stars
3) works great my wife love this bag and her new laptop would highly recommend this to anyone who is look for a way to store their laptop when not in use if you want real protection you should probably look into the large leather case or a hard case if they exist for our purpose this works great around the house and office
4) works great with ps i bought this usb hub for the sole purpose of providing supplement power to an external hard drive the hard drive is a western digital passport that has capabilities so this hub was ideal the ps like many laptop do not have the power to support some of the large external drive that exist it is self power ac plug included and it can also support the only downside to this unit and it is not enough to reduce my rating is that the usb hub is not power all of the time the hub is only active when the primary usb output is activate have power full time would be nice for charge controller ipod etc overall a great product that works great
5) works great great price dog chew through the factory hp cable coming from the oem transformer so i bought this one and a new outlet cord they work great in tandem and provide extra length over the factory unit great value",Sony PlayStation 3 Blu-ray Disc Remote,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71aGPQRTNNL._SY606_.jpg,['The remote control uses Bluetooth wireless communication to operate playback of Blu-ray Discs (BD) and other types of disc media on the Playstation 3 system.']

","1) nice ps accessory if it was design better i originally bought this remote because i was too lazy to learn how to navigate with the regular controller i got tired of have to wait from wake up the ps controller to pause my movie or to resume i gave this device stars because it do what it was design to do it lack features that you would find on a standard remote and its poor design ill start with all the bad stuff since that what you want to know about the product before you buy itwell the biggest reason people buy this is to have a device that make a movie easy most people watch movies in the dark so have button that would light up or glow would of help most of the better manufacture remote come with this featurelike most other people complain this stop button will take you back to the ps screen instead of just stopping the movie and go back to the main menu certain movies have a autoresume feature that will let you jump back at the same spot so if the movie you are watch doesnt have that feature it become very inconvenient to have to so search for your spot i also dont know why they didnt combine the pause and play people complain that pressing any button will turn on your ps what most people dont realize its because of the bluetooth which was a very poor implement for a remote bluetooth was meant to be use for device transfer low data rate and security the ps is actually in a standby mode than turn off when it is in standby the bluetooth is still active and when it recognize a command it will wake the ps up to receive command a feature of bluetooth is to shut off after a period of time of inactive to save power this is why some people complain about have to press a button twice first press wake it up and the second one execute the function of their choice after saying all that it still suck that you turn on your ps every time a button is accidental pressed the only advantage to have bluetooth is that you dont have to point it at the ps to use itif you rub you finger or thumb lightly over any of the lettering on the remote you can feel the texture of the letters if you can feel the lettering that easy that means the manufacture print the lettering on top without any type of coating what do this mean it means that after a good amount of use the lettering will rub off and you will have to know what the button doesthi probably doesnt affect most people but if you have an old ps you might have to update your firmware before it works you have to have firmware v or higher to use the remotesony has been in the business of making electronic device and this definitely did not show any ingenuity for a device that you can only use on your ps with the exception of the analog sticks the remote has every button you can press on the ps controller in the center of the remote i guess you can look at it like an oversize ps controller overall if you are wanting a remote to watch your movies instead of use your controller and you dont mind spend roughly then this would benefit you if you dont mind use the ps controller for all your needs then you can definitely pass this up i dont know of any bluray that require this remote to access certain features
2) cheap replacement if the price is right this purchase was to use as my dedicated travel power adapter i didnt want to bring my oem power adapter with me because after travel overseas ive learned the affect of what dirty power can do to power supplies the main reason why i purchase this specific model was for the power usb port since most standard usb port doesnt supply enough amperage for my tablet this would of been a good solution for when i travel so i wouldnt feel like an outlet power adapter was use on a hp dvt cto laptop before i bought this i saw some review from people state that the tip didnt fit their laptop i wasnt too worried because most hps use the same power adapter im sure there are model out there that doesnt follow suit like other model i do know that hp isnt big on use propitiatory item with that being said it came with a tip that had the same fitment as my original adapter i cant comment on the other tip since i dont have any other laptop to test onto start off the advertising pictures of this product is very mislead they depict the power cable plug towards the front of the laptop and the usb charge port nicely set aside i didnt catch that until i try plug in the power cord with the usb adapter which is on the left side in the back then it dawn on me that i never seen a manufacturer place the power port in the front of the laptop if you plug up the charger without the usb adapter it works out great the degree angle on the connect tip help tuck the cable along the side or the back of the laptop once you plug in the usb adapter with a usb cable plug in and you have your laptop in your lap or at the edge of a desk it make it awkward because of the weight of the usb adapter will pull down the cable you can easily disconnect the cable by accidental tug on the cable with enough tension in order for it to work out well you would have to have your laptop in the center of a desk large than your laptop and be close enough to an outlet for the plug to reachthe usb charge adapter claim to have a usb port i plug in my tablet asu transformer infinity tft to the usb port and it did not charge it the original tablet charger is rate at a i try use different cable to isolate the possibility of cable incompatible i didnt expect different cable would matter i just try it in case someone leaves a comment about swap cable i would have like to publish the actual amperage of the port but i didnt have the time or the test leads to fit in the usb port i want to return this product in time to get a refundone thing that had me slightly worried about this adapter is that the plug only had two prong my original adapter had three prong and i like the comfort of have a ground connection the overall build of the adapter seem pretty solid i didnt have the product long enough but i would have to guess if you were frequent connect and disconnect the tip that the cable connection would come apart easilyoverall if you purchase this for about and didnt plan to use the usb charger this is a great product for you if you are look for a replacementspare",Sony PlayStation 3 Blu-ray Disc Remote,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71aGPQRTNNL._SY606_.jpg,['The remote control uses Bluetooth wireless communication to operate playback of Blu-ray Discs (BD) and other types of disc media on the Playstation 3 system.']

","1) bluetooth only is a step backwards the sony ps bluetooth remote wonderful control all the bluraydvd function on the ps such as the numerous fastforward reverse and frame step mode that the ps features this remote buttons which would definitely be better backlit are laid out in a fairly logical manner and the unit is very responsive in use and because bluetooth use radio wave instead of infrared beam of invisible light you dont have to point the remote at the ps to make it work which is a very nice feature when youre lazy lay on the couch however i give this remote a rating of only because i feel that sony has taken a huge step backward in use by now add a technology to home theater that isnt compatible with standard infrared remote technology my gripe is that this remote cannot control volume something that i find is often need while watch movies after all the years we had been subject to have or even remote on our coffee table to control our entertainment experience along come inexpensive universal remote that could reduce it to only technology had once again deliver on the promise of an easy experience i personally believe that bluetooth is a more favorable technology and perhaps it will ultimately be pervasive in our lives when it become as inexpensive to produce as infrared unfortunately because the sony ps shortsighted doesnt recognize infrared and this remote isnt universal i am now once again and worse yet my wife sorry dear relegate to figure out which remote to use for what im sure that on this remote it would have only cost them a couple of dollar to add at least the basic control of volume of whatever device we would want tv or av receiver or perhaps better yet the ps should be control by universal remote that already exist or someone needs to come out with a truly universal remote that can handle both infrared and bluetooth id also like to see a universal remote that could also support radio frequency rf device such as hunter fan but then im a dreamer by the way ive discover that the myriad of buttons on the standard sony game controller can do most anything this remote can in regards to bluraydvd playback but if you feel that a regular style remote feel better in your hand then by all means buy this i did because except for my gripes above it works great

","1) works just like it claim we bought this remote christmas gift because i read past review about its reliability and ease of program but the biggest reason was that it was able to control a niko lcd tv that my son has in his bedroom he also has an xbox and comcast digital cable tv boxand this remote do a fantastic job working all the component with all of their features nothing was left out program was easy with the online feature and we had no issue connect to the website to do so although we did wait until a week or so after christmas to do itwe read that right after the holiday that the logitech website is inundate with new buyer try to program their new remote and the site would bog down the buttons have a firm feel and are position convenient it doesnt feel cheap at all its a nice solid unit that i think would last for quite awhile we have a sony remote for our family room with an lcd touch screen big heavyand it didnt control all the features of the device that we program into itand it was twice the price of the harmony remote im look to replace the sony with a logitech as i write this so far so goodhigh recommend
2) it works fine i bought this to use on my son ps because i wouldnt let him take it to collegei want the bluray player for our hd tv in the family room while he was its good to be the king the remote is more conventional look for our family to operate the player than use the game controller as for it not have all the right buttonsi have to put the dvd in the machine to watch a movie so it not have a power button is no big deal as im already there to push the power its remote folks its not meant to cook you dinner it has what you need play scan fwd scan rev chapter fwd rev pause else do you need plus its bluetooth so you can lay on the couch and control the show from any angle and that important to me to enable it just read the directions and it will take you through the menu and it works perfectly first shot no rocket science here for the price amazon charge for this sony made remote i didnt have to go to a second party provider and deal with any potential issue they ship it for free and it arrive quick and in excellent condition
3) great storage for the money i seem to gravitate towards kingston sandisk brand when i shop for memory cards and flash drive storagebut the deal always seem to be with the kingston brand they are afford reliable transfer data at reasonable speed and are design well i prefer this style of drive where the plug is protect by a metal swing away guard the one that are slide out seem to be less reliable over time even when use gingerly this one transfer video data with no shutter or any lose of picture my only wish is that they would all come with lanyard so they can be found easily when they wind up in a drawer of near a computer i seem to misplace them from time to time over all this is a major score for the price
4) great speakerwhile it last its with a heavy heart that i came to amazon to write this reviewwell not really a review but more like a statement of this speaker shortcoming ive had this speaker over month now and when it work it was for the money i got a great online deal for ship not amazon unfortunately this thing had clarity great bass response and decent range while use my ipad blackberry and window laptop it was even better when use the enclose altec doggle when i stream from my desktop computer i was total satisfy and recommend it to anyone that came to my house and heard the wonderful sound coming from this speakeri figure weve use it maybe to hour at most when the problem start first issue was that it got very difficult to pair with my window laptop internal bluetooth device i would have to delete it from the device printer folder rediscover it and then it would work againa pain but i kept it up until it wouldnt connect at all no matter what i did so i use the altec doggle and it work finenow all this time it work perfectly with my ipad and any phone we use to connect to it with so i figured it was a window thing not long after the laptop issue it start to arbitrary disconnect from any device we use to connect fromit would reconnect right away when would disconnect every to minutes or so another pain but we persevere because the sound was awesome when it was workingthe next issue was that if the battery was die normally we would just plug the speaker into the charger and continue to listen to musicwell that stop happening every time we would do that it would immediately disconnect while play and we couldnt reconnect to any bluetooth device while it was plug init would charge but we couldnt use the speaker until it received a sufficient charge and then it would reconnect but only when disconnected from the charger another painbut we persevere in the name of great sound and a week later the death blow occur it stop recharge altogether and went dead when you connected it to the charger the green light would go onthen slow go chargingnot able to at as a you have it when it work it was awesomebut now that im reading all the other reviewer issue i had to chime in with my brief time with this speaker truth be told after reading what i just did im not even go to attempt to return it why get aggravate and spend additional money on it only to get disappointed all over againsorry altec but base on what the other reviewer are saying about your customer service or lack thereof this will be the last product i will purchase with your name on itand every desktop speaker system i have and have ever bought has your name on it spend money has gotten quite tight these days and i cant afford to spend it on substandard product that a company wont stand i finally spoke to altec and got a very nice young lady on the phone she said that what i experienced was a common issue with this speaker and advise me to remove the recharge battery for a few minutes reinstall it and see if it would charge again you slide the remote control out of the back of the speaker and remove the tiny screw to remove the cover from the battery compartment to unplug the battery unfortunately this didnt work for me and im now debate on whether to incur the cost to send it backand im leaning towards no and im now look for a new speakerim heavy considering the oontz

","1) very happy with purchase i purchase this a few days after get a gb ipod video i am very happy with this toughskin and the belt clip is a great feature the case really is the best available in my opinion it is easily remove if need i give it stars thanks for a great product
2) bluetooth remote will really impress since it looks like many here have mention the biggest downside to the remote which is the power button i will elaborate on what i think is the coolest thing about the remote which is the bluetooth i personally dont mind the lacking power button its not that big of a deal to hit the ps button and choose shutdown its not like you have to get up to turn it off but the most exciting thing to me is the bluetooth i still find myself point the remote at the ps out of habit but it is an awesome change from my other remote some of which dont work if you are accident block part of the ir i think this will all remote in the future and a few years from now we will wonder why the heck we ever use ir remote that need line of sight for the price of this remote i think you will be very pleased
3) excellent receiver at this price level i bought this receiver after purchase return a sony receiver that was broken right out of the box i have never own an onkyo until this one and i have been impress i primarily need it to use with my hddvd player replace with a ps and my xbox i found the setup to be quite easy and i use hdmi and optical cable yes there is some confusion about hdmi audio but i knew what i was get considering the price level of this receiver i have use the receiver quite a bit in the past month since anytime i play video games or watch rent movies it has to be on with my current setup i have yet to have any issue with the unit and i am very happy with my purchase is it the best on the market of course not but i think it is the best at this price level if you have im sure you do a lot better but if you just need a basic home theater receiver i can recommend this unit
4) great for quick backup or on the go file storage i own numerous usb flash drive and although most of them still work okay i find myself buy a new one every year or so since they keep get big and cheap this kingston gb model is a great value and i like the retractable feature as oppose to worry about use a cap the device works perfectly right out of the box and you can start use it immediately the amount of data storage is great considering the amount of photo video and music people have these days i use this one to not only keep a portable copy of my music but also to keep a few application and document i may need on other computersbottom line great device that offer lot of storage its easy to use works right out of the box and is a great value for the money
5) good combination for speed hard drive space i have use quite a few solid state and hybrid drive now and i think its important for people to understand the pro and con a completely solid state drive is go to be the fastest hand down however you should consider the solid state fastest available you will most likely see a large increase in boot time opening application etc expensive the market for ssd is still relatively young so they are still expensive for their size which bring us to the next con disk size most average afford solid state drive are not that big compare to standard or hybrid drive gb gb are common large driver are a lot more drive small portion ssd such as gb rest is standard speed hybrid drive try to get the best of both world by have a small ssd part for the os to boot from and a large standard drive for file storage price is much more afford to many people size hybrid drive are available in a large format such as this tb drive so its large enough for most people to use as a direct replacementthi particular drive is a decent replacement since it offer a tb storage capacity if you current have a standard drive you may notice a decent speed increase use this drive however it will not be as fast as an ssd drive however if you prefer to have decent boot time combine with large storage it is a great fit and the price is afford for most people",Sony PlayStation 3 Blu-ray Disc Remote,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71aGPQRTNNL._SY606_.jpg,['The remote control uses Bluetooth wireless communication to operate playback of Blu-ray Discs (BD) and other types of disc media on the Playstation 3 system.']

","1) much better than use a controller this remote is a great alternative to use the ps controller since you either have to leave the controller on all the time while watch a movie drain the battery or have it set up to shut off after a set period of time cause you to have to wait seconds for the controller to turn on before push a buttoncon although minor i will agree with the other reviewer that it would be nice if the remote were backlit or glow in the dark but that is definitely not a deal breaker half star loss the remote itself is rather large and features several buttons that i never use half star lossa for the stop buttons location between the play and pause button i would have to say that it is not a big deal in that if you are use it in the dark and need to pause the movie you know that the pause button is the bottommost large button on the remote my feeling is that it allow you to quick pause a movie without have to even look at the remoteoverall i would definitely buy this remote if you watch a lot of movies on your ps
2) no need to buy expensive cable this cable is great and the price is amazing there is no need to buy the overly expensive name brand cable as they dont do anything different than this cheap cable they have done study compare the difference between cheap knock off cable the really expensive cable and some of the those inbetween the result show that the cheap cable perform the exact same as the other cable why spend more for nothing i would highly recommend this cable to anyone i have of these and have never had a problem and even if you do have a problem they are cheap enough to replace without any headache

","1) uhhhhh it works the ps come with an incredible short usb cable for charge your controller as such leave that plug in and use it to navigate is a no go i use my bluray time as time to recharge my controller because of the incredible short cable and use my remote to control my movies and maybe checkout the psn store its the best ps remote current available it looks very nice and high end you can tell it was well made rather well builtthe problem come in the actual use stage setting up the remote is rather simple that not a problem but it could be easy for the less technical soundthe worse thing about this remote is if you touch button your ps come on this is stupid if you got your remote on a table and you accidental set another remote on it while your watch tv guess what ps pop on better make sure you setup your system to not auto startthi would be so much better if only the ps button effect the power up of the ps but that not the caseanother option that would eliminate this is a simple hold button that is also not the caseanother problem with the remote is its not illuminate i know it doesnt say illuminate but i like watch movies in the dark after a few movies you know where the buttons are thankful we have some colored buttons they are not too obvious to see at night but you can make out ok this is red so push the button above it to see the subtitles or below it to see how far into the movie you are speak of which why cant we see how much time is to the positive which i think outshine most of the negative but not the fact that the stupid ps turn on whenever a button is pressed anywhere put this thing in its own box and keep it shutit looks very good the xbox remote looks out of place with the rest of my decor as my tv remote is black receiver remote is black tivo remote is black ps controller is black it only make sense to have a black remotethe remote looks very high end and works without problem not count the issue of it turning on when you touch it not have a power off button and have to hold down the ps button then choose cut system offthe biggest feature is bluetooth i have a xbox and i got that remote its a joke you have to push buttons several times and it become increasingly frustrate because you have to have direct line of sight this ps remote use bluetooth technology and i can point this thing at my head the opposite direction and it still operate my psthi is a nice remote i recommend buy it as it is better than use your ps controller it is better than some of the cheap off brand remote especially those which require plug in some hideous look device on your usb port and it looks good but understand you will have some compromise
2) well price tripod that looks good outside and in the studio i have bought many tripod througout the years lightweight tripod a sweet carbon fiber tripod and several that have prove to be nothing more than junkin all that time my favorite go to tripod is this manfrotto pro tripod it is well design looks great and hold up well with extensive usei go hike times a month and use my tripod several times a week outside i also use it inside somethe benefit of this tripod is it is built like a tank it can support your heavy body camera with a heavy telephoto lensplease note that this tripod is a professional tripod and as such they expect you to have your own head i highly recommend this head as it is the most versatile out there and works perfectly with this tripod manfrotto rc horizontal grip action ball head with rc rapid connect plate i went shoot with a friend in the mountain i had my camera with battery grip hooked up on this tripod and head taking photo of some ice formation when the wind start blow hard my friends tripod flew out from underneath him cause his camera to drop and break always wear your neck strap you use it to protect your camera its not a fashion statement my tripod didnt budgethe only downside to this tripod is the weight and the fact that it do not come with any carry device meaning you need to carry it with your hand how much would it cost to throw in a cheap bag must we have to pay for a strap for the bag but i digressif i had to do it over again i would always buy this tripod if it got stolen or fell off a cliff there would be no choice i love this tripod you cannot go wrong with it and i highly recommend the head i mention above it will support a heavy camera with a long lens they also look well together as if they were design to be together out of ps another cool feature is the tripod has hand warm meaning when your out in the cold freezing the grip do not freeze your hand off so you can still work with and touch your tripod but try not to touch the cold metaloverall im really impress with this tripod i do not think you can do better if your wanting one for the studio you could use this one as well it will be hard for little kid to accidental knock it over but can still happen but it will not turn over because of a breeze i mainly use my on nature hike and tripsi recommend buy one of the following if you go hike i own tripod bag pad carry long strap carry strap gray
3) a star product do what it say and looks beautiful i recently went from have several computer workstation to a single laptop i did not want to backup everything on disc i already have things back up on external drive and i didnt really want to just sell my drive with my work on them i have load of pictures video and d render store over tb of spacei was at circuit city and seen this case it is from antec a company i trust and like and it works with internal sata drive as long as they didnt screw things up this was go to be a good thing they did not and it is so easy a caveman can do it darn you you take your sata drive out of your computer open up the antec case insert your harddrive screw in the screw they fit easily with my western digital gb drive then insert the drive and backing into the case and plug in the power cord once that is closed you screw in black screw very easy and it looks great tooi have of these right now in use and they all run perfectly look fantastic are slim make no noise do not have glaring lights and work the way you would wantthese look great and work great transfer are fast and the unit do what you want it tooif i have a complaint it is the stupid power supply the thing is slant sideways and take up port on your power supply why they cant use standard power supplies or supplies connected to a power brick is beyond meif you are go to be setting these up and keeping them on your best bet is to buy the surge protect known as powersquid it is here on amazon that way you can keep them running at the same time without mess up anythingalso while i am at it if you want a usb hub that match these drive perfectly then i highly recommend the low price and highly functional cable to go port usb hub that is also available here on amazon it match the design of the enclosure perfectlyall in all a perfect product it do what you want with no this model only has usb function which is fine if you need high speed transfer for video i would recommend a firewire setup or nas and this will cost money

5) if you want a mouse that track well dont buy this i wrote a review for the original keyboard the wire version bottom line love iti was wanting a wireless keyboard and mouse i figured the mouse might not be the best base off review but i was line this setup is one of the most comfortable setup you can buy bad thing is the mouse will not track right more on this soon meaning you try and click something the mouse lag or skip then you move past your target frustrate if youre try to check your email about as bad as death when try to play a video gameso if you want a cheap wireless keyboard and mouse to use while connected to your tv youll love it that why im keeping this for my pc if you plan on use this as your main keyboard and mouse skip it for the love of all that holy do not buy itlong reviewthe keyboardthi is a fantastic keyboard i love the layout the feel of the key everything i think this is easily one of the most comfortable keyboard you can possibly ownthe palm rest feel amazing and i just love this keyboard so much so it kill me to give this thing a bad review but i mustcon half the time its not responsive meaning you try and press a button and its not recognize i play some games was play call of duty and battlefield cant count the times i die because i just couldnt move couldnt jump couldnt go left couldnt do anything non responsive im all of inch from the wireless device no lovei had the usb stick on the back of my computer that didnt go over well put it on the top of my case same problem put the keyboard right next to the usb dongle put it on my desk same this play a game you got a kill streak go great if your use this keyboard mouse then it happen you spot this guy you go after him you start shoot mouse acts up and start lagging you end up hit the rock next to him he see you start shoot you try and move out of the way not happening the keyboard become unresponsive and you just you respawn and you cant move you just get kill awesome rightthe mouseyou thought the keyboard was bad pffft i was being easy on it heck i love it compare to this posthe goodfeel great amazing in your hand the usb charger is ac power meaning it take no usb slot on your computer good and bad good because no extra slot get use bad because you cannot make it wire i thought if the wireless was bad i could always plug it in and use it as a wire mouse like the raze mamba lol silly me its wireless the mouse is very comfortable fit well in your hand and you can use it all day sadly i have for about a week but if the mouse doesnt trackthe con i could write a book here but im go to show some restraint the track on this thing is horrible i thought my old mouse pad was bad raze game exact pad which i paid almost buck for so i bought another game pad a high end one the raze and no love same problem let me walk you through typical general pc listen to some music you click to minimize the window or heck maximize and instead you end up click the close button or accidental moving something who know this thing is crazy ive accidental move stuff to folder because the mouse acts high end game play a game you spot a bad guy and you zoom in to shoot him you get ready to click the fire button and your mouse go nuts the cursor jumps to the left or the right or even worse you lock on and start shoot he move but you cant move your mouse nor zoom back out because the mouse hang up this mouse is single handed responsible for destroy my kdr in games meaning how often you kill someone instead of being kill if youre thinking hey why dont you move out of the way good idea forgot the keyboard doesnt work heck im have problem type this fact the only thing this mouse is good for is knife and not even all that good either i have the middle mouse button map as my knife and sometimes i switch weapon instead of knife because of how sensitive the wheel put you will get kill own slap and possibly even ban because of how horrible you will be if you use this mousebottom line for the person who wants to use this setup on their couch when use the tv with their desk they just need to click on the web play some causal games or select the next movie on netflix or hulu this will work fine and is quite comfortable if not a big large for those needs for anyone who plan on use the mouse and keyboard for day to day operation just now i was try to hit play again in window media player and accidental start a game of battlefield how can someone even make this stuff upi dont know what the issue is i think it has something to do with the wireless but it do not work righti hooked up an old ancient keyboard and mouse and everything works fine no issue at alli recommend this keyboard but buy the wire version and i cant recommend this mouse heck it has even shed on my mouse pad black stuff is on it all in all a horrible do i recommend instead here my new g game keyboard mamba wireless game laser mouse professional game mouse if you want this keyboard in wire get it by click this wave keyboardi love that keyboard the only con is its not illuminate which make it hard to use at night if you want to play a game or even use the computer in the skip this

","1) good pictures good size great memory battery hog first off buy several recharge battery when you get this camera as soon as i got mine we play around with it for no more than or hour before the brandnew alkaline battery were useless flash and the builtin monitor really suck em besides that the olympus dl is my first digital camera now im not really great at taking pictures so i put most of the setting on quotautoquot and hope that i can photoshop them into look better later on the picture quality is good overall but if you want any sort of detail capture youll have to use the largest pixel size available and zoom in too so forget about try to get those great concert shot from row back most of my work is on the internet so its great for web publishing but i doubt that these pic would look that great if they were print out but i havent really try yet eitherthe compact design is quite good so i cant believe some other reviewer here said that his fell apart after a week i know ive carry mine around in my book bag for week on end and it hardly has a scratch on it if you want to change the camera setting there a lot of button push to change the shutter whitebalance and image file size option my friends have gotten quite tired of pose and wait for me to switch around to large size or to zoom in or to take the picture over again because i flash when i didnt want to and there a slight delay between when ive pushed the button and when the camera take the pic the often take a couple mintue to prepare also the pictures ive taken often look fantastic on the lcd monitor but are fuzzy when i download is a snap sort of just install the software once then hook the cable up to your serial port and wait it take several minutes to download multiple pictures heck it even take a while just to view all the thumbnail in the editor the edit software included is okay but its no photoshopthe very first weekend i had it i went to a crazy drunken club party and took lot of pictures of people dance around in an alter haze surprising most of the photo came out great very fun and colorful except when the flash go off people often have red eye which is fix through adjust or if they are close to the camera the flash wash them out like white ghost and if i didnt use the flash then they came out smear because the shutter was open too long since it was compensate for the missing light it definitely take some learned skill to get great shot on the flyin comparison though for the price you pay here you are get a really good deal with this handy little device the lowlight photo are a bit grainy but quite bright considering a normal camera would show the same situation as nothing but black i havent yet figured out how to get it to take pictures so that it looks dark lit on purpose it always seem to automatic compensate also the multiphoto option and the mode are fun to play with but not necessarily go to be useful to me in the long run on one mb card you can fit about big file but ton of little photo and remember recharge recharge recharge
2) super versatile very helpful solid i bought it because of the good review and it deserve them its a solid piece of equipment metal clamp on bottom with plastic swivel parts at topit can really be twist and manipulate to point the camera in just about any direction from hand object have also use it to clamp camera to a pole to raise above people when standing in a crowdthe only criticism the round head inside the clamp come off easily i imagine it will fall off and get lost one day it do have a cork surface though which is clever so it is less likely to scratch delicate surface and the other side is wrap in rubberi would definitely buy this again
3) beat the controller too many buttons though i cant imagine not have a remote control to use the ps to watch movies this one works good but there a lot of buttons on there and the behavior of the assign buttons is a bit odd sometimes still much better than try to explain or guess which button on the game controller make it fast forward the most annoy thing about the remote is that there no power off button
4) small handy quick needs better stabilize and low light the review i read on this are a little too generous its all right but not spectacular mine is a replacement for a highdefinition hv that i share with my inlaw i can never get my hand on it so was hope for something inexpensive alldigital with good video is good in bright light soso indoors and very grainy in lower light but it do a good enough job if youre just try to preserve something right away i dont think any of the video shot is use as professional quality not even semiprofessional perhaps it could be use a secondary camera like if you were look for a nd simultaneous shot to do a cutaway but i would definitely suggest spend more on a hidef camera instead of this if you care a lot about quality the easy button is nifty though for when you get tired of push buttons and sort through menu for the perfect settinga a camera that shoot still give up i was total not impress with that you can turn the led light on once you figure out where its hidden among the menu but it is no substitute for a flash dont think youre go to get a satisfactory in videostill experience with this device nor can you use this as a webcam or import video directly from the camera to your pc unless you have a capture card that will accept the rca video outit do zoom in pretty good but the image stabilize is a bit weird and the focus can have a hard time finding its mark ive use a camera before where you could shake it like an earthquake and it hardly show at all on the recording unfortunately the fs kind of float around the image when its zoom in youll be able to see what youre recording later but wonder why the image sway around so much fully zoom out it do a good job there no viewfinder only the flipout screeni play with a lot of idea in low light and the review i read were mixed for lowlight quality but they really should have been on the bad side yes you can tell what youre look at but its extremely grainy to me im disappointed in that aspect the most there different option i dont get the point of widescreen on a standard definition camera the video just look squishe when play back in window media playerthe av out jack is not design for regular headphone youll get a loud buzz in your ear if you try it i suppose ill have to find some kind of wire with stereo female rca jack on one end and a stereo female minijack on the other or splice something togetherthe builtin microphone do a pretty good job i think if youre tape yourself and flip the screen around to see the handy input meter disappear for no good reason the external microphone jack require a battery power microphone so youll get dead air if you try to use a headset or unpowered mic to record sound i should have seen that coming i supposethe battery life is pretty good take long than expect to charge the sd card is much more convenient than use tape after hook up the usb cable and the power cable simultaneous i can download the videosthe software included is pretty dumb pixela imagemixer is for video while the video solution disk is for still image only kind of confuse and backwards fella if youve got vista then window movie maker will do a pretty good job of edit your videosi dont know overall this camera is all right i guess but i had higher expectations for the price i paid i got this camera from a bigbox store but should have wait and gone with amazon better offer its definitely small and handy but not go to get you any award for artistic quality production i recommend it for anyone whose look for something simple and consumer quality only
5) low price lower your expectations update junk update years later the lens cracked inside but that doesnt matter because the camera no long record any video its just a black screen not worth fix just money down the drain so dissatisfy with the end result i will not buy sanyo again im stuck with good expensive battery for one bad camera had a sanyo cg for a couple of week its okay for what it is but honestly an iphone will take much pretty video this is a pocket camera and as such you should not expect much morei took lot of different shot in lot of different kind of lighting the autowhite balance is extreme a close up of a bright green lamp shade will turn gray after a few seconds the only way to stop it is to use the white balance program option which i found unpredictable at best especially in low indooron lightthe size of the video is good definitely beat standard definitionthe battery is very small last maybe or minutes when in use you must use the charger and there is no ac adapter included but a volt plugin hole is available i could not find a battery meter on screen but it will tell you that youre about to run out you must also provide your own sdhc memory card i prefer to take the card out and pop it into an external reader which was fine no external microphone jack and an prong rca cable is provided for audio one for video correction there is a battery meter but it is only accessible while you are not recording so you cant tell while recording something long if you are running out of light is awful extremely grainy or underlit its really a daytime camera where the video is much clear also zoom in and handhold is not go to look good zoom all the way out or with a tripod are the only viable option a tripod of some sort would be require since the vertical nature of the device make it not likely to stand on its own stabilize is subpar and the zoom button is a vertical thumboperate switch that do not make for smooth recording or slow zoomsi took some footage inside a loud nightclub and was surprise that the audio was not blown out by the volume and bass that nice there no volume meter on screen so you dont know what youre get update the automatic audio attenuate is overdone leave the sound tinny highpitched and hard to listen to on play back in some situation no way to turn it offa another reviewer said the file are mp and not native to window vista movie maker or media player free winamp can play the audio but youd need to get some kind of converter mac imovie work fine though update quicktime ustream producer will play mp video fine on vista and window will tooand the still photo button is pretty useless very slow its best use is to get the camera to focus on something that the video button is not do very wellthe menu are okay better than i had the same problem with the soundtrack not matching the video and that took a lot of time to correct with edit and i also had a problem where the camera would not focus at all without tap on the device like the motor was stuck not good its brand new the focus is kind of slow when it worksid give it stars but with the lowprice of this product one can only expect a simplify result and that what it do best a simple fairly easy way to capture video moments youre not go to hollywood with any of this footage and try to get great shot is just frustratingi bought this as an interim camera because i dont have much cash on hand but i want something to capture moments go by now id recommend searching for something else really save for another month or two and get a midprice canon or sony",Sony PlayStation 3 Blu-ray Disc Remote,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71aGPQRTNNL._SY606_.jpg,['The remote control uses Bluetooth wireless communication to operate playback of Blu-ray Discs (BD) and other types of disc media on the Playstation 3 system.']

2) absolutely amazing wow that the best way for me to describe the tv i went from a tube tv to a inch toshiba dlp and thought the transition was great when i bought this samsung i felt the dlp i had was my old tube tv the picture is phenomenal i hooked both my xbox and ps and play games and was amaze how clear and crisp the picture look the detail and picture had me speechless but that was just the beginning of itwhen i placed a bluray disk alien vs predator into my playstation and play it i was in awh i couldnt believe the clarity the still speechless i felt this tv just put my dlp to shame one of my gripes about alien vs predator was the scene in the movie when it was dark i had a hard time making out what was go on not with this tv i could see the alien running around in the tunnel where as with my dlp i could barely make them out it was a frustrate experience to watch on my dlp not anymore with this samsung you can see what was go on in the intense action scene with perfect motion clarity and no haze or blur another thing with such clarity i could see just how fake the alien were something i couldnt do with the gave the tv a star rating because the sound system was less than spectacular it really doesnt bother me since i have a samsung surround sound system it also would have been nice to up date the firmware with the network internet connection instead of have to download the firmware onto a usb flash drive and then plug it in to the tvif you are in the market for an lcd buy this model right now i swear you will not be disappointed the price may make you look at a cheap model and brand but i guarantee the price of this samsung is well worth it

2) alright remote wish it could do more this remote is nice for anyone who use the ps to stream or play dvdbluray video to allow it to function like any other dvd playersome issue i have with the remote is that it can only control the ps and the buttons need a light feature as it can be difficult to see in the dark its also nice as the remote works instantly and do not need to be power on like a controller and doesnt automatic turn off like the controller which means it do eat a bit of batteryanother is that any button can turn the ps on which can be bad if you accidental push a button but as for some saying you cant turn off the ps with this remote is false while there is no actual off button you hold the ps button like on the controller to turn off the psi do wish that this could control more than the ps and as of now there is a new remote that is able to control other device with the remote also such as your tv i will soon be connect this to a system that use a harmony remote so i will be buy a receiver for the ps and ditch this remote while connectedthi remote will still keep me company for when i move the ps around but will soon have less use for it as i do now if you are look for a remote to control more than just the ps you should look at the new model release by sony

","1) hate this remote well if nothing else its reliable ive had mine for two years with no isssue and ive change the battery maybe once in that time even despite extensive usea a remote though this thing has long been a thorn in my side the buttons are small and cumbersome poorly label and laid out lucky im very familiar with the ps so its no sweat for me but for the nonp member of the family its incredible complex to describe to someone how to usethere no dedicated power button every button can turn the ps on but none turn it off i cant tell you how many hundred of times ive accidental turn on the ps with accidental button press many without my knowledge and waste electricity because i didnt realize the ps was accidental turn onthi remote is practically useless with the ps web browserthere no analog control to move the pointer around on the screen so you have to use the controller to navigate around web pagesthe remote times out after a few minutes of nonuse so if you need to quick pause or do something with the remote you have to press the buttons a few times to wake it up to work againand because the ps only use bluetooth and has no ir sensor no reasonably price universal remote will work with this thing so you either have to buy an expensive multi sensor remote or get an ir to bluethooth these issue will be address by sony at some point but for now i hate this remote but im stuck with it its better than use the ps controller but not by much
2) great for recreational reader student research should get the i never thought i would ever embrace digital books but i think this reader has forever change that every concern i had about an ereader was its just like reading on paper in fact it took me all of about minutes to realize that i actually prefer it to paper with paper books you get shadow you have to angle the book depend on which side of the page youre reading on etc here the ambient light is distribute even by the material on the screen so the text is easy to read and there is little if any noticeable glare or reflection some people dislike the lack of a backlight but i actually prefer it because its much less stressful on the eyes the background is a soft white color that very easy on the eyes you can resize font to your preference the size available here are plenty its especially great for incredible nearsighted people like me who like to take their glasses off when they read and not have to squint between all of this it make for a very comfortable reading experience i can read much fast on this device than on paper i guess if i had to nitpick the only thing that distract is the silver finish of the device itself which actually reflect more light than the screen if you think this could be an issue for you id recommend a dark its a breeze its incredible easy to use and everything is very plainly label turning page bookmark and zoom are all perform with single button press your library is organized alphabetical of course so just navigate ansd click it also remember your place for you and in addition you can create your own bookmark while in a book you can use the numbers on the side of the screen to key in a specific page number its just the right weight and it feel just right when youre use it the software is very itune like in both appearance and function it generally works as it should though i find it a bit slow than id prefer when perform function of browse the sony ebook store one function i was surprise was missing was the lack of ability to edit file info in the software if you get an ebook that incorrect label there really no way to fix it in the softwarewhat ive found is that its best to bypass the software and probably mac as well recognize this as a mass storage device so you can put all your content on the reader use window explore or mac finder much fast you can transfer books via drag n drop in seconds as oppose to minutes use the software you can download google books directly from google easy to browse and drag them to the books a ton of it i find the sony store to be a bit too pricey though the bestseller are pretty reasonably price but everything else costs just as much as its paper counterpart so if youre look to save money on paperback and such buy off for now until the price drop if indeed they ever do the best thing is the integrate with google books grant its all old stuff but there a lot of great classics on there that should be in everyone library it also dispay txt doc and pdf file so you can make your own content for example if you use the firefox browse and have the addon install you can literally print any page to a pdf and transfer it to the sony for much for comfortable reading for local news website or magazine it also support the epub format and allow digital library checkout unfortunately no library in my area support this as of yet but im hope they do soon this could revolutionize the concept of the libraryfor better or for worse as far as storage again some have gripe about there being only mb of storage only mb is use when you consider most ebook are or mb in size this allow you carry books around i dont know about you but ive never need access to that many books at once in my life but if that an issue look elsewhereso that my breakdown of the device up a bitthe big decision i had to make was whether which model to get kindle the sony or the the big drawback with kindle is drm it seem like a very control and lock down system sony support many more open format plus i dont care about wirelessit drain the battery quick and i want to spend as little time charge a reading device as possible plus as i said books are plenty for me to carry around as far as readable the kindle screen looks big but the amount of reading space is almost identical between this and the kindle kindle use more screen space for display battery life etcwhere as the sony use literally the entire screen i also found the kindle font look more thin and computer like whereas on the sony the font is nice and almost identical to the font youd see on paperso then the decision was between the touch screen and this model without get too much into it ill simply put it like this if you are a student or research get the it has a builtin dictionary the do not a word search function the ability to make note scribble on page and it has greater upgrade storage the also has mp support while these features are neat for someone like me who read for entertainment i found them kind of pointless or unnecessary also the touch screen model has more glare than the and the screen seem dim probably due to the touch layer for what i want to use it for the give me a better experience and the contrast is much better for easy readingi dont think i will ever give up paper books but from now on most of my recreational reading will be done on this device sony did a fantastic job of blend old with new and once you start use one yourself you too will be hooked a fantastic and revolutionary electronic device
3) unreliable you get what you pay for this cheap route lose connection with the modem several times per day display a solid amber warning light so it needs to be continuous restarte there is no rhyme or reason to it and once it drop when every single device in the house was power off if and when it connect back to the internet the signal strength is spotty at best this is my first and last belkin route go back to linksy
4) frustrate device with so many great trackpad on laptop you wouldnt think it would be so difficult for someone to simply create a standalone version to use on a desktop pc but that do seem to be the reality this device is simply too frustrate to use and likely ill be return it its not so much a learning curve ive use trackpad on laptop for years the biggest problem is the texture of this touch device whatever material plastic they use do not allow your finger to slide smooth over the surface it always feel like your working against this thing because the material put up so much resistance to your movements which make for a bumpy ride against the surface this result in numerous accidental double click scroll etc in fact if your work involve alot of drag and drop as mine do dont even waste your time even attempt to use this as your primary input devicealso there is no mention in the instruction of the setpoint driver other than a tiny little asterisk footnote on one of the page if you are brave and patient enough to try and use this device for an extend period of time you must install these driver as they enable many of the features that make this device useful like horizontal scroll in web browse etcthe dead zone is another failure of this device as other have pointed out there is a nonfunctional border around the outside of the touch surface that is not texture so if you get too close to the edge the pointer simply stop again frustrate if you need to to alot of drag and drop unlike a trackpad on a laptop there is no continue drag beyond the edge option in the driver software should your finger go too far it simply stop and you have to attempt to pick up and drag againthi also is not a true multitouch device there are some finger sroll option but you cant reverse scroll direction for natural up and down scroll nor can you reverse page backward and page forward control for browse and there is no pinch to zoom which is inexcusable for a touchpad window do support this feature my pc has a touch screen where both natural scroll and pinch to zoom work i find no reason why these command cant simply be port onto a even despite fresh battery and the receiver being about inch away literally from the trackpad this thing lag and drops out at random for no apparent reasona much as i want to like this thing and have been searching for a few years for a good trackpad so i could finally ditch the mouse there simply too many negative to recommend anyone buy it and likely ill return it barring some kind of miracle or last minute firmware software update that address these issue even if they did it wouldnt fix the fact that the surface is just not user friendly i would just say stick with your mouse until a better touchpad come along if ever",Sony PlayStation 3 Blu-ray Disc Remote,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71aGPQRTNNL._SY606_.jpg,['The remote control uses Bluetooth wireless communication to operate playback of Blu-ray Discs (BD) and other types of disc media on the Playstation 3 system.']

","1) just an optical cable the connect are too bulky to fit next to other connect in the back of most receiver not necessarily worth the higher cost of monster brand

",1) instruction for pair are unclear i dont know maybe its me but at first i didnt think to use the controller to register or pair the remote to the ps and it wasnt mention the instruction assume that everyone should know these things and what a xmb menu stand for plus it doesnt say how to find the setting that have a logo like a small suitcase or whatever its supposed to be but you go to the dvd setting for the tv a menu appear then tap the left directional arrow on the controller until you find it then x select it now you have to arrow down to find the accessory setting with this goofy logo and select this then it will give directions to register the remote by pressing the enter and start buttons simultaneous until the screen change that took off and on about minutes i was wonder if i had a bad remote i change the battery again and spun them around pressed both again and held it and finally the screen change and it said that the remote was register i still dont like the fact that you can turn the ps on by pressing down the playstation logo but cant turn it off unless you do so from a menu on the tv screen why is that maybe i change my mind about turning it on i have to get up to turn the ps off its not that im lazy but why doesnt a remote control have an off button plus amazon give me two review selection for a game and not for a ps remote how much fun is this game how do you rate this game overall duh its a sony bluray remote control and not a game and i must say it was no fun figure this out or get it register and since there no off button i gave it a star rating and yes that stop button doesnt work the same as on my dvr but let face it the us doesnt require compatibility compliance as some other country do so we just have to bite the bullet however it do make life more complex remember which controller do or doesnt do what or how,Sony PlayStation 3 Blu-ray Disc Remote,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71aGPQRTNNL._SY606_.jpg,['The remote control uses Bluetooth wireless communication to operate playback of Blu-ray Discs (BD) and other types of disc media on the Playstation 3 system.']

","1) a must have for any ps owner i cant believe i wait so long to buy this thing i use my ps primarily to watch netflix and bluray nowadays i fumble with the standard controller for a couple years when i finally broke down and bought this i think my favorite feature of this is that it never go to sleep every time i want to use the standard controller i had to wait for it to wake up and pair with the ps i can see how some people may be annoy by this controller power on the ps on accident by pressing any button but it doesnt affect me because i normally flip the power switch on the back of the unit off when im not use it to save power
2) a little underwhelmed this is a nice lightbox but it isnt very convenient to use it do fold up nicely for storage though i made this purchase expect to have to iron the backdrop but i didnt realize how wrinkle prone they would be also the white backdrop the one i want had dirt mark out of the box and seem to have more each time i look at it im constant clean it once you get through the ironing and clean it do a good job of produce soft light the frame do not hold a square shape well though so my front cover doesnt fit anymore but i didnt ever care to use it anyway if i could go back in time i probably would not have bought this product base on the level of effort require to maintain it
3) great for computer case clean like the other review i purchase this item to clean computer component due to its lack of bitterant it is a relatively large size bottle which is very nice i am very pleased with my purchase i think this will aid my regular computer case clean dramatic
4) value surpass price these speaker surpass expectations for the price they look and sound great my previous speaker had deep bass and more pronounced mid but their high werent as crisp and i paid a lot more for those previous speaker also the previous speaker were big white box that look terrible these speaker look great next to my monitorkeyboardmouse they are piano black with a small tower shape that take up very little space i can see how some people might have a fuss with the control box but honestly im fairly sure ill hardly ever touch the thing since i primarily control my volume from the keyboard
5) amaze for the price from what i can tell this is the exact same proportions of the canon factory hood this fit my mm stm perfectly both normal and reverse it make my lens look significant more professional i do wonder how much the canon hood felt inner coating make a difference but i am sure the hood presence is a big factor than the coating for prime i really dont think this deal could be beat though",Sony PlayStation 3 Blu-ray Disc Remote,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71aGPQRTNNL._SY606_.jpg,['The remote control uses Bluetooth wireless communication to operate playback of Blu-ray Discs (BD) and other types of disc media on the Playstation 3 system.']

4) a weak thumbsup i was in the market for a new mp player for awhile now and was really on the fence about which one i should go with after some consideration i eventually settled on the xmp playernow that i have it set up im pretty happy with it there are a few detail i want to go over nothing dealbreake but definitely issue id have like to have seen done a little for what im happy with ill start with xms service although i truly believe the channel lineup isnt nearly as unique and diverse as it was before xms takeover by siriu i still find myself give it an albeit grudging thumbsup with over ish station at your fingertip you should have no trouble finding something to listen tothe screen clarity is beautiful and the backlight is terrific it was only in the brightest sun that the light start to wash the screen out a little and make it hard to read the scrollwheel pioneer use for the xmp player should also make the unit physical design familiar for anyone coming from an earlygeneration ipodim told xm deactivate a portion of their terrestrial repeater as part of their merger agreement with siriu i didnt notice a signal quality any different then i was get with any other unit in a perfect world id have love to have seen the antenna integrated into the unit a little better but that certainly not go to be something i get all aboutthe menu setup on the player itself i thought was really easy to jog through and well conceive it was pretty simple to switch between mp playback and live xm service there a total of gig of onboard memory for mp storage and an expand microsd slot for more space also included is all the necessary equipment to set your unit up at homea i said before generally speak im pretty happy with it there are however several really aggravate issue things i believe do the xmp player a disservice and hold it back from being a real fivestar piecethe first and biggest issue for me was the simple fact that the xmp player isnt compatible with itune at all now i love itune i think the way it organize my library of mps and the way you can assemble a playlist is just the best thing out there and not by a small margin it was incredible dishearten that not only will itune not recognize the unit but the xmp player isnt able to play acc file itune default fileformat this will leave any mac user really scramble to try and find compatible software to use xm do have a moderately decent program available for download but its still not nearly as good for the record i loathe window media player although a home kit is included for the life of me i cant understand why you cant plug a usb cable directly into the base as oppose to the unit it would be lightyear more convenient to not have an extra cable to connect when the player is charge in its base i even think they by they i mean xm use the design im talk about on past unit the helix and the nexus its something i just dont understand at all complicate things the included usb cable is about two feet long this forces you to either buy a new cable or connect the player to your computer through a which i think looks completely ridiculous when its connected and charge at the same timemy final complaint is over the cost after purchase a car kit this is a piece that costs close to about threehundre dollar if it was up to me id have made every effort to try and line this unit price up with the ipod nano what you lose from the ipod is the ability to view video and pictures what you pickup is the ability to listen to satellite radio that however is a paid service and hardly seem like a fair tradeoff when the xmp player is so expensive pioneer for years has been notorious expensive this unfortunately do nothing to buck that i still give the xmp player a thumb up i just wish i was able to do it with a little more enthusiasm for me finding a setup for both its software and its accessory was more of a chore then it should have been especially for the price i feel i was ask to pay",Sony PlayStation 3 Blu-ray Disc Remote,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71aGPQRTNNL._SY606_.jpg,['The remote control uses Bluetooth wireless communication to operate playback of Blu-ray Discs (BD) and other types of disc media on the Playstation 3 system.']

","1) way better to use with movies than the regular ps controller without get into many detail think of this as a regular remote you use to watch movies all the basic functional are there play stop pause fwd eject etc and plus you get the colored buttons that so far a few movies have use for extra content or remote powers on as the ps controller by click on the ps button you want to turn it off without navigate through the ps menu simply push it for like seconds and you will be ask if you want to turn off the system click enter and youre donei had been use the ps control to watch movies and while not a painful process it was sometimes annoy to press triangle to pull the menu and select the option you want this control solve that problem like a charm also consider it is a bluetooth remote so it can be use without even point to your ps or with thing on the waygreat value for the money amazon will sometimes drop the price to which make it a better deal
2) a major flaw ruins it the new belkin for the new ipod classic could have been perfect there are many pro in this unit that made me go for it above other similar product that i will list belowit is sturdy and closed perfectly it is very difficult to open it even when you intend to it fit the newest gb ipod classic information not provided anywhere in the package and worth mentionthe opening for the headphone hold button and usb connect are wide that your average ipod case this is great as i use my ipod mostly in my car which means that i dont use the small ear bud included with the ipod but an aux cable instead the hole for the headphone in prior case i own was so small as if design to be use only with the official ipod ear bud and the aux cable would not fit this is not a problem with this casethe complaint i have is that the case include a thin film that protect the control wheel the so call click however the ipod wheel will sometimes not respond because of this i remove the case and use the ipod without it to confirm there was not a problem with it and i can confirm the problem only presents when use the case i will probably end up remove that protective film but since it is actually attach to the case i am afraid it will not look that good after i remove it
3) great product for very small camera i got this as i love taking photograph and have had experience in which i have wish i had a tripod like this so i could place it in place in which my regular tripod wouldnt thing to mention is that this thing is so small i dont think i will use it and not because it is a bad product but the problem is that i own a sony cybershot dsch which is quite big for this little addon as soon as i placed it on it the little thing fell down which means i will not be able to use it at least for that camerai do own a little flip video camera and it work marvelous with it since the camera is light and small i could place it in lot of place without the tripod even it is a good product if you intend to use it with small camera take a look at a sony dsch if your camera is similar in size or big dont get this
4) convenient do exactly as describe from the outside this may seem like your average laptop case it is made of nylon fit up to widescreen laptop and has features that are standard like a file folder storage compartment and a trolley strap quite handy when travel in a black and elegant design it also has a zip down workstation with enough space where you can fit many if not all the accessory you may have for your laptopwhat make this product different is the zipthru design an enhance in which the case open right by the middle isolate the laptop from the accessory this come handy when travel as when passing through the airport xray scan area you will no long need to remove the computer from the case if youve been there you know how it is well that the competitive advantage this case has over other another nice thing it has is what they call the air cushion system these are polyurethane pillow that surround the laptop protect it from both side and vertical is a huge upgrade from my old laptop case and i am very happy with it keep in mind that the main advantage it offer are for people who constant travel and pass through customs in the airport have that in mind i highly recommend this item

2) great quality backpack but a bit expensive i actually use the canon eg photo backpack and its about the same as this lowepro but for a lot less money sure its not quite as well made and sturdy as this lowepro but its also not nearly as expensive while i wouldnt really hesitate to buy this lowepro especially if it were a bit cheap im very happy with the canon backpack as i get nearly the same functional minus the builtin all weather sheath for a lot lessa note about the layouti like this style photo backpack better than the type where the camera gear is placed in the bottom of the pack and the top part is for other item this style is more space efficientit can hold more lens and photo gear in the main compartment yet the outside dimensions of the bag are less grant you do have to take the pack off and set it down to access it but i try a tamrac backpack the kind where the camera stuff go in the bottom part of the pack before buy the canon one and i found it way too big and not any more convenient to use as i had to also remove that one from my back to access it in the end the canon pack and this lowepro hold extra stuff too in the flap pocket i can fit a shirt light lunch and other item like a magazine in fact i can even fit a small laptop in the main compartment in a separate laptop slipcase for protection i would say a laptop would fit fine but not a or large oneif you want something that you can work out of without have to take it off and yet carry all of your photo gear i doubt you will ever find it i would instead recommend a shoulder bag that you carry only one or two lens in for weight reason for walking around with and a back pack for transport all your stuff i also use the backpack for long and it works fine not fully loaded too in other words just because you can take every single photo item you own doesnt mean you have to or should
3) works with both usb and usb this is a great usb hub for the price i have both usb device and usb device plug into it and the usb device operate at usb speed with no problem it seem to be a misconception that it will only operate at usb if you plug usb device into it not true for meim quite happy with this hub now i have plenty of usb port it works flawless and was price well cant really ask for much more than that

5) i have very few complaint with this palm i purchase this palm after have an i for a year i got tired of pay the high wireless fee with the i and not get good service it was extremely slow and in my opinion not worth the high service costi decided i did not need wireless internet access from a palm device since i can check my email from my cellphone and i want something as small as possible the tungsten w and tungsten c model are big than the tungsten t the tungsten w has high monthly service fess while the tungsten c only works in and around building with wifi connective which is not very many yet i suppose if you have wifi at home and at work and know that the public place you frequent have wifi it might be worth considering the tungsten ci like the fact that you can slide it closed over the graffiti area it make for a nice compact unit that can slip into a shirt pocket without feeling weigh down i downloade an application call graffiti anywhere there is also one call which works well which allow me to write graffiti anywhere on the entire screen so i dont have to flip down the palm as handythe color screen is quite nice and seem perfectly one major complaint is with the cover that come with the tungsten t it is a separate clear plastic thingy and although it do not add much weight or bulk to the unit like some case do and you can attach it to the rear of the palm when the device is in use its still a bit inconvenient to have a separate piece to contend with i recommend a flip cover such as the pocket solution cover up its a hard metal cover that fit the tungsten t to protect the screen yet flip back and out of the way when you are use the unit important it add very little bulky to the unit im sure there are other good case or cover too but i dislike most leather case because they add too much bulk to only other complaint a small one is that the datebook do not come program with this is understand since palm is sell unit all over the world and each country celebrate different holiday i found and downloade a freeware application call holiday which add the us with option for some other country holiday with easemy tungsten t has exceed my expectations so far the screen seem more scratch resistant than prior palm i dont know for sure if this is true or if ive just been lucky but i dont use any stick on type of screen protector i think they take away too much optical clarity and my screen is still total perfect to get the dust off the screen i use a lens cleaner call clear sight and a microfiber lens cloth and have had good result the trick is not to clean it more often than you really need toif you want a palm that is strudy small and compact i would not hesitate in recommend the tungsten t it seem to be built quite sturdy the case is metal and it is very fast in fact i was surprise at the speed of launch different application when i first did so",Sony PlayStation 3 Blu-ray Disc Remote,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71aGPQRTNNL._SY606_.jpg,['The remote control uses Bluetooth wireless communication to operate playback of Blu-ray Discs (BD) and other types of disc media on the Playstation 3 system.']

2) this thing was design by engineer ok so youve read a few star review that mention that the stop button is sandwich in between play and pause and if youre like me you may think to yourself meh that not a big deal however let me make two points here unless youre very careful you will hit stop when you meant to hit pause and you will do this often most bluray disc dont support autoresume a step backward from dvd but i know what this means dont you if youre watch a movie and the telephone ring youre gonna hit stop on the remote accidental and end up back at the ps menu and youre gonna have to start the disc again from the beginning this happen to me times tonight while watch dark knight and if youre easily offend you would not have want to be in the room with me to hear the profanity that was spew from my am angry at the person at sony who is responsible for the design of this train wreck of a remote because i know they did it on purpose nobody could be so stupid as to do a thing like that unintentional
3) not as high quality as some velcro tie but good value for the money i have purchase a couple of pack of these cable tie from where there of them in a pack those are of a higher quality than this product from velcro but they also cost a lot morethe question is are these velcro tie good enough to get the job done that depend i personally wouldnt use them if youll be use them with cable that youll need to be constant readjust but for regular cable management for your computer desk or whatever where you put them on and leave them alone these should be fine theyre a bit flimsy but unless youre constant fiddling with them i dont forsee you have any problem with them theyre certainly more sturdy than twist tie and more convenient than zip tie so im use them to wrap up all my spare cable that i keep in the closet and ill definitely be buy more ifwhen i run out

","1) high quality high definition highly recommend in the past i have try other ps component cable that were cheap in order to connect my ps to a tv whose hdmi port were broken i already concede to the thought that the picture might not be as good a hdmi but was gladly proven wrongthese cable will connect easily are gold plate and have great connection to the port they are not loose and they are very solid as well there will be no need to wiggle the cable just to get the connection to stay once connected you can rest assured that they will stay connectedthe joy of this product that may help other as well is that it is backwards compatible to the ps it work for mine atleast individual result may vary it allow me to play my psp games in hd qualitywhat more could you want quality this is of high quality from the gold plate connection to the cable itself as well as the gold plate connection to the actual ps everything is sturdy and thick to keep the cable from crimp and lose quality as well as loss of connection at either endi would highly recommend buy this cable instead of any after market brand this beat the rocketfish monster and generic cable that i have try in the past stars across the board
2) better than expect i bought this switch because of the minimal wireless strength i get in my room i decided to hardwire my ps and two computersi was expect this switch to be rather large and cumbersome but since it was go to be hidden it wouldnt matter for me this was definitely not the case it is no large than by about very this do not come with any ethernet cable just a warning to those who need to possibly buy more to use on this up was a dream i plug the live ethernet feed into the first slot this leaves the other four as output to run my two computer ps and small caveat though it has one input and four output for those who think this is a port switch it do have port true but one is use as an input switch if you need more you can daisy chain these switch or simply buy the large is completely silent has almost no heat and works immediately out of the box no software no bloatware no freeware no ware at all just plug in and surf the webi can not think of a con for this device at all it is wonderful and cheap it do not run hot at all it make no noise the only thing it has is lights that might annoy some at night if its visible in a bedroom just hide it thenthi deserve a full review i will definitely buy more if i have a need for more",PS3 Component AV Cable,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61GlAeak8rL._SY550_.jpg,['Features Separate Left And Right Audio Plugs For Connection To An Amplifier Or Hi-fi']

","1) a quality route for a good price trendnet has always made some very good route and this little route is no exception i have use the same linksy route for years and it was time to retire it however finding a quality wire route was very hard it turn out in the end i stumble across this route and began to do some research into itthe twswca is actually the th version of this route it was originally produce in and went through multiple change v vr v and vr vr was produce in i believe and contain the latest firmware jan the original version of this route had a different design and a blinking red status light the latest version change it to a blinking green light i received a vr which is the latest sometimes you might end up with a and some site are even sell v original which is very strange since trendnet doesnt produce those the route design itself is ultra simple this is a route normally so compare to a linksy you will see some difference the plastic casing is light weight and kind of feel fragile next to my old linksy w heady duty plastic or better yet my netgear spi firewall routerwhich broke in about a year which has a metal case however you arent exactly throw this thing around so for a device that sit on a counter the light weight plastic design is helpful to keep it cool it just has this toy look to it the port in the back are plastic w metal pin to hold the rjs in place simple but it works the lights themselves are very simple and not over glaring like the game route from dlink which actually can hurt your eyes if you look into them because of how bright they area proper function vr model will have a solid green power light flash green status green wan light that flicker w activity and the port w a network cable attach will be solid green that flicker with setup trendnet route use some of the best route firmware on the market it is done by an outside company which specialize in network firmware and software and supposedly they are one of the best the firmware is windowso base meaning when you hook up the route and get go input your route ip and it will have a browse base firmware which will be like surf webpage this keeps it very simple for people who arent familiar with network since it let them put in help bar extra tool tip and make things look much nice cable user this route works out of the box wo even a need for setup dsl user and other will require minor setup but this is easy as there are setup method this setup is pretty much steps time network ip network information lan setting in other words the route will ask you to set your time select your isp provider cable dsl etc input network information if require by your isp clone your mac if your isp only grant you ip base on your pcs network card i didnt have to clone my mac id for it to work but my friend bought this same route and he had to so well this is a case by case basis if the route is not working out of the box clone mac id in the quick setup step after do that the route work perfect for my friend advanced this setup avoid all the steps instead you are taken to a setup page that has all the firmware tab wan lan setup firewall etc within each tab are option to use this is for advanced user as tweak a few things here can screw up stuff however in the advanced setup menu you can go to lan and change your route ip address the ip range the route hand out lease time etc you also can set up dmz firewall features port forwarding etc everything is well organized and help option are everywhere it is so much similar than my old linksy in the firewall option there is a feature call block wan ip i personally would enable this basically this prevent the route from receiving ping on the wan side via your isp now if you enable this and sudden you lose internet then disable the option some isp do ping your network to make sure you are there however most isp will not instead hack will ping along the network look for a response if you do not block your wan ping you ping back and the hack spot you and move in for the kill is it necessary no but it is nice to have story here this route is a fantastic wire route i call it the little route that could and then some as this route is half the size of my old linksy yet has x the throughput mbp wan to lan this route has a very simple design with very high quality firmware that make it very simple to setup while cater to advanced user i highly recommend this route for its price current while you will get a very cheap look route the inside are high quality just look past the toy design and youll see this has some high quality parts inside of it and that what count in the end it works and it works welli highly recommend this route if you are look for a high speed wire route that can handle multiple computer and all great things there are a few negative to this route minor one port closed not stealth stealth is just an imaginary term by grc test basically it means your port isnt visible or respond to outside data access that was not this bad not really because this route contain block wan ping my old linksy and netgear route did not have block wan ping but did have port filter so pretty much it is one or the other from the research i did you can filter port make it stealth or just have the route block all ping request from the wan side setup cd i get so annoy with these honestly these setup cds cause more problem than they resolve in fact some cds wont even work on window vista or window these cds are really design for user with window and where you had to configure

2) reliable long lasting rechargeble i have own a set of lenmar aa recharge battery for about month now i picked them up to replace a set of aas from another brand that couldnt make it past month before failing or becoming completely worthless charge wisefor about month now these battery have been real trooper id say they have been through perhaps cycle already and still have a very strong reading when test mah this is a plus as the battery are still holding about an charge after nearly month of constant positive i find about these lenmar battery is they hold their charge very well after fully charge they dont quick drain off like some recharge battery do to me at least these feel as if i am get a brand new battery after each charge and have yet to see a difference in the quality sometimes after a lot of cycle recharge battery begin to lose their charge much i would recommend these battery if you are look for a good quality set of rechareable with the potential to have solid charge with each give a solid charge even after month not one bad battery yet out of the pk built to last has yet to show degrade even after cycle they are able to hold their chargecon possibility of poor quality control see pk and pk size while this has not affected my pk i purchase you should make sure the battery a charge upon purchasenote the description say rate for cycle according to the package mine came in they were rate for about cycle expect cycle on charge your battery use a slow trickle charge this ensure a stable long lasting charge and will not impact the battery life fast charge will degrade the battery over time
3) excellent quality cable for your ps ps needs i use hdmi for my ps but due to a lack of svideo and rca hookup on my p hdtv my craving for some of my old ps title was left unfulfill until i picked up this cable i do not own a ps backwards compatible ps the provided component av cable is an official component cable design for use on the ps and ps system the cable has rl stereo audio and support y cbpb qualitythe included cable is surprising good quality the main cable itself is heavy duty with plenty of length to it feet the connect head are very high quality and durable the entire cable itself has some good weight to it the only real negative i could see about the quality of the cable is that after the ft of heavy duty thick cable it splits off with the connect head each connect use a thinner wire still in the cable defense the thickness and quality of the connect wire are vastly superior to the official ps svideo cable sony was sell back in the qualityp it has been a while since i use my ps via svideo but the component cable did seem to have sharpen the color quality of the games nicely these cable wont make the games look hd by any means so dont be shock when you still see jaggy but what you will get is much crisp and higher quality image reproduction it do help very subtle i would say this is a must have if you plan to use your ps for psx or ps there is a big downgrade in image quality use these over hdmi but that is to be expect hdmi make a huge difference for pp title when compare to the ip title of the ps i would only use these for a ps if you do not have hdmi on your tv the good thing is component do a good job at handle the current gen ps title far better than svideo and rgb do in my psnot hard at all really if your ps is current use svideo or rgb turn the system on and change the display setting to y cbpb crpr and save it switch the console off swap wire and you are good to go if your ps is set to rgb you will only get an audio output to the tv the system will not display an image if for some reason you are unable to hook your system up via here are the steps to follow to enable the proper video system on down x confirm down x each down will make a sound x confirm left this should enable component mode i am use a version ps but the system config should be the same as with the new slim psif your ps is brand new out of the box nothing to worry about as the system will autoconfigure on first boot however if you have been play via hdmi or another video option and switch to the component give you a black screen there is an easy fix put your ps in standby mode red light is on press and hold the power button for seconds you will hear a beep then a beep beep this reset your video option and the system will auto detect your component am very impress with these cable the overall quality is very high and have official sony support for both the ps and ps is a nice plus even though i only got these for my ps if i still had a sdtv this would be the perfect in cable a worthwhile investment for someone look to give their ps graphics a little extra boost of color and a great alternative to the standard cable included with the ps starsnote many ps games do not support progressive mode this means that despite have component cable the game will output at i games which support progressive mode will output at p with component cable resident evil i believe support pnote if you already own ps component cable these will offer virtually no visual improvement over existing ps component cable just better quality the package for this product is incredible overkill it is that ultra thick heat seal plastic package that everyone hate so best get your meanest pair of scissors out when this arrive
4) the mighty light for the everyday reader the mighty bright xtraflex is a versatile light that fit on all books and even some question while out of the box and even with aaa battery the device is fairly light the construction is fairly sturdy and this little device put out quite a mighty light below i put the light through some test and outline the design features this light has note i do not own a kindle so i was unable to physically test it with a kindle design the xtraflex is design to clip onto kindle paperback and hardcover books by way of a clip the clip design itself is fairly sturdy and get its grip from a small spring located under the hood of the clip the base and clip portion have small pad rubber grip to avoid damage to your book or the kindle frame the flex is about inch long after bend the light head over the book the base itself serve as a stand for the light and the storage compartment for the aaa battery when battery are placed into the device it has about the weight of the battery oz the device itself use led they give off a nice coolwhite bluewhite color the device use a push button to control the lights test i put the xtraflex through a bunch of test range from bright of the led quality of the clip covering for the battery etc there are plenty of pro but also a few con people need to be aware control these are control by a pushbutton on top of the head the button feel very solid and durable when you depress the button you will feel a tiny click that let you know it work by default the light will turn both led on at once press it again to turn off one led and press it a third time will turn the device off the push button is a bit sensitive i could easily see the device being accidental turn on if tuck in a draw so be neck the neck itself is well design and sturdy it feel construct to withstand a lot of abuse and is easy to mold while able to retain its shape there are a multitude of angle in which you can bend the device you can even tilt the head on a steep angle but in do so i feel it could damage the wiring inside so i would not recommend create sharp angle with the bright this is a mighty bright light for real the output of the two led live up to the hype that they are high intensity led with two led go i could see this being a problem for someone lay in bed with their spouse one led bring the level down to a more manageable level with only one led in operation expect about a drop in bright and a drop in coverage with standard size books the light was more than ample to cover both page however large books prove to be a problem even when clip towards the spine of the book for maximum coverage on both page a simple tilt of the head fixed this expect about inch of coverage depend on your portion the clip itself is sturdy and able to fan out about inch without much effort give you plenty of room to chomp onto that kindle or book the clip itself hold very well to books and i could see the rubber felt grip do a fine job holding onto your kindle wo scratch it up the dimensions are the clip are as follow inch deep inch wide what will this light work with do it fit my kindle what about paperback books this light is advertise as a kindle light while i do not own a kindle i took measurement of the clip and began to compare it with spec for various kindle this clip will safe fit on the old kindle model without a problem the rim for old kindle appear wide enough to fit the clip without risk screen damage rd generation kindle however will have a problem the rd generation lost about inch in width while keeping the same inch screen this means the boarder is small and thus the clip will overhang onto your screen block text and risk damage if you own a kindle rd generation then i suggest you look into one of those kindle cover w the built in led gen and gen work gen as long as the clip can secure grip the frame it will work just works flawless just clip to the front or back works with a bit of adjust do not clip to the cover or back of your paperback or you risk damage them instead take about page coverback and clip it to the middle of the bunch this give the device enough weight to support it without bend your book or cause you to fight with the light overall this is a great clipon light it is built sturdy yet fairly lightweight excluding the battery the neck is strong enough to take some abuse the clip itself grip well and has rubber grip to keep your book or kindle frame look good as new and the led are crisp and bright it is a very simple design yet a lot of effort was put into it there are a few minor change i personally would of note but overall this is a quality book light if you do not own a kindle generation this will be perfect for your nighttime needsnote the onoff switch while quality could easily be accidental engaged it would of been better to have a simple switch put on the base of the devicenote battery clip is sensitive be careful when remove it as i honestly do not trust the sturdy of the the device runs on aaa battery or a v dc power source adapter sold separate in most case

2) good but buy an hdmi cable i bought this thinking foolish it was an hdmi to hd component cable why no one has made a good one is surprising however i use this on my cousin ps and it works quite well i would however only buy this if your tv doesnt have any hdmi port open
3) great durable headphone these are pretty reliable headphone and relatively inexpensive i bought these after my jvc or something cable sort of broke because of the straight headphone jack design thankful i bought those for the great thing about these headphone is that they stay in the ear pretty well sound great albeit bassy durable and incorporate a degree headphone jack which allow for more protection when pull the plug out of the device

","1) very cool simple and elegant this case lives up to the description and the review its well stitch the lining is a nice choice of soft material the macbook air fit snug inside and the faux leather is really well done i actually kind of prefer that its not really leather i like the magnetic closure the envelope design always get a smile or a nod or a head turn you look badass rolling into a meeting with your airbook in this case
2) total overprice but great result my set up a ps on a i hd lcd television the difference between use the old rca video cable and then get this component cable is like night and day everything from the ps looks a million times better this is as good as your standard def ps is gonna look on an hd screen but with the component out you can set the ps to output to a x aspect ratio so at least its do a full screen blow up this cable is crazy expensive for what it is but if youre still use a ps in an hd world its probably worth get
3) cheap and cheap made be gentle okay ive been on professional set a ton so i know real sandbag they are sewn shut and they are bulletproof sure and they are a piece this set of bags for is a great deal the zipper are plastic tooth but of reasonable quality i read a bunch of review and took the advice to fill them with pea gravel rather than sand it just made sense considering the bag isnt technical seal so for worth of gravel from home depot you can get more expensive even small pea gravel at a pet shop look in the fish dept ive got reasonably well made sand bags that do the trick or do is not a handle on the blackon side of the bag there is only a handle on the blue and black striped side if they would have add grommet to secure the middle at the handle and given it a handle on the blackon side stars but for the price its hard to like them but they are cheap so be careful i made the mistake of treat one like a real sandbag and toss it it split right open on the seam and out came all the sand filling and went everywhere i threw that one out lesson have these on set a bunch i am wish more and more that id fill them with sand ill update again after i swap the to two bags now they keep tear open when you set them down they are just cheap but even if i buy a second set im still ahead of the game if id bought into matthews bags
4) cant be beat for the price i am type this review on the keyboardon a mac there no usb port on this keyboard which is a bummer since that typically where i plug in the mouse but the action is nice and the mac recognize it without any trouble one of the review said that the key light up they do not i wasnt expect that for but would have been nicelook great feel good very happy with it

2) excellent for macbook pro i bought this for myself but my wife use it mostly as she travels a lot more than i do it has enough room to store all of the mbp accessory she needs to take with on trip including her heat shift pad and it help to be able to unzip it straight down the middle when go through airport security if we both travelled a lot together and took both laptop id buy another
3) works with mac mini server mid just upgrade my mac mini server mid from gb to gb with this it recognize the memory right away with no issuesnote im not sure about some of the negative review whether they were due to not being properly or actually due to a defective product as far as i can recall ive only use corsair brand memory once before in a macbook pro early which also work first time and has been ever since i would have no issue buy this brand of memory this same machine also has a boot camp partition with window which also doesnt have any issue with this memory not that i expect any
4) works right out of the box central florida switch isp from not so bright house network cable service mbp to centurylink adsl service mbp plug it in turn it on wait for adsl sync reconfigure apple time capsule from static to dhcp and reboote after a few minutes everything was in sync mbpsnote i did actually call centurylink tech support at one point as it didnt seem to be connect thought we had pppoe service and need usernamepassword but they said they dont use pppoe only dhcp they provided the internal setting which i checked were already the default in the bridge after a reboot and a few minutes of patience it work with no change to the bridge default and no change to my exise time capsule setup except to switch it to dhcp service appear to be configure as always on so no change in from prior cable serviceupdate no change to review or rating just note that after month of x use it continue to work well with no issuesupdate no change to review or rating just note that after almost a year of x use it continue to work well with no issue also we had a service interrupt this past weekend after talk to centurylink tech support they noted the adsl sync from their end but that the modem wasnt get its ip configuration they initially suggest calling the support line for zoom but before we end the call they received an outage report for the area which was resolve within an hour once the centurylink was resolve the modem obtain the ip setting on its own without have to power cycle it again
5) nice system i originally bought this to replace a broken dvdvh combo system i dont use vhs anymore the bluray feature is useful as we only had a ps in another room previous i also like the iphoneipod dock for play music although i dont use it as much as we dont have wire network in the room where this is located i connected this to an apple airport express which then also let me connect the output of that to the aux input on this so that we can use airplay instead of have to dock a device which then also make it easy to control playback as the stereo that our main tv is connected to appear to have stop working ive considered swap this with the ps in order to have surround while watch movies on that tv againthe only drawback for me is that this one is instead of the that my other old stereo support but i didnt need in the room i originally bought this for when im actually ready to buy another new unit im likely to look for a similar sony model with in reading some of the other review i cant say much regarding sound quality as i wasnt expect the best of the best from a system in this retail price range i just want a simple allinone bluraydvd player with amfm radio and surround and at least one aux input i have much better and large speaker set up in the room where i mainly watch movies with surround you get what you pay one of the comment about network im somewhat confuse as to why the reviewer said it should have come with wifi or ethernet as it do come with ethernet and is how mine is set up although the other end is an airport express as i already had that i didnt feel like spend additional on the unitasker wifi adapter for this",PS3 Component AV Cable,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61GlAeak8rL._SY550_.jpg,['Features Separate Left And Right Audio Plugs For Connection To An Amplifier Or Hi-fi']

","1) just what i was look for we have a box of old slide from my inlaw and have never look at any of them we did not want to get a slide projector just want to get a better look at what the photo were this is a simple inexpensive way to sort these slide i am also interested in try the trick that someone mention whereby i could take photo of the slide with my digital camera use this device havent try it yet but might come in handy anyway very happy with this little gadget
2) everything add bulk i want to like this case as it has what i am look for in a phone case it has complete protection for the screen and the phone itself without the need for a separate screen protector the case has component to it the hard plastic inner shell which prevent any immediate damage to the phone itself after the hard plastic casing is in place the soft rubber part of the case fit over that and snap into place better than some less expensive case ive try the feel of the soft case is great you will not feel like you will drop the case once this is install if you have small hand and can hold the s by itself with this case you may not this case add a lot of width to the s which was already a big phone and almost make this as big as the galaxy note with this case on i can still easily access the fingerprint scanner camera speaker and usb plug the buttons remain responsive and easy to click on both side i use the headphone jack quite frequent so i would have to assume that continual remove the flap to access the headphone jack might cause it to wear down over time the front portion of the case has a significant border that keeps the phone screen from being anywhere near the surface underneath it but again this bulk is noticeable i prefer to use a phone case that has a belt clip available and the belt clip that come with this case is very sturdy the phone click solid into place and is unlikely to accidental fall out while on a belt overall this case do have everything im look for protection add grip and a belt holster the add bulk however is a concern for me that even with large hand it do change the size of the phone in a noticeable manner
3) simple and works great this is such a simple idea but it works so well no liquid no mess just a little eraserlike thing that clean computer and tv screen if it get dusty you just brush it off everyone who is into electronic media will want one of these i am happy to have review this product
4) perhaps good protection but not too stylish this cover is not bad it is a little old fashion look for an ipad cover though i might use it some but i like the zipper case that i have which has a pocket for the cable power cord i have the flip open magnetic cover and think i prefer it to this even though mine do not have the same stand capability as this belkin one this may provide good protection for the tablet but it sort of looks like an old quilted handbag sorry this feel a little bulky and hide the beauty of the slim technology so all in all for me it is just okay
5) nice speaker first off i was surprise at the size and weight of these speaker the photo make them look much small ok they can be use with a cell phone which looks dwarf with these a better application seem to me to use them with a tv for much improve sound than many flat screen deliver this works very well i cannot give a lot of technical description just that these speaker produce a very nice sound in a stylish colorful way",Otterbox Defender Series Samsung Galaxy S5 Case - Frustration Free Packaging Protective Case for Galaxy S5 - Neon Rose (Whisper White/Blaze Pink),https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81MMDjOj%2BlL._AC_SY879_.jpg,"['Robust, 3-layer protective case withstands drops, bumps and shock', 'Scratch protection - Your device stays as pristine as the day you brought it home with side and back coverage', 'Shock-absorbing interior - Case absorbs and dissipates shock, cradling your device from drops', 'Slim Profile - Boasting a smooth surface and slim profile, My Symmetry Series fits right in your pocket', 'Precision fit - Each card is precision cut to fit perfectly in the window of My Symmetry for Galaxy S5']"

2) dont buy these headphone which will break in less than a year my initial review was great i said i really love these headphone they are comfortable make a quick bluetooth connection with my ipod just add a bluetooth dingle like sony and an armband ipod holder or anything else bluetooth and provide good quality sound for workout they have their minus you cant get them wet so people with sweaty ear should not buy them and they are not well made so if the set you get doesnt work right dont wait to return them but there is no better set of wireless bluetooth headphone available and it is just great to have your music with you when you run without worry about wire the control on the headset are very easy to operate tooi stick with what i said before about liking wireless headset and easy to operate control but let me repeat these are not well made my fourth set just broke will no long take a charge and i give up they always break always sony headset are more expensive but sound just as good and i will bet they are more durable i would add that although these headphone are reasonably comfortable the earpiece tend to bounce out of at least one ear when running and you cant wear these headphone and sunglasses at the same time
